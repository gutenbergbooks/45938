<h2>PUBLIC CHARITY AND PRIVATE VIGILANCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By FRANKLIN H. GIDDINGS, Ph. D.</span>,</p>

<p>The Comptroller of the City of New York deserves the thanks
of all good citizens for his serious indictment of the abuses of
public charity that have grown up in this city and State within the
past ten years. Probably very few of the more intelligent men and
women of the community were aware that three million dollars,
raised by taxation, are annually appropriated to the assistance of private
charitable institutions, over which the public has no real control
and only the most shadowy authority through the inspection of
the State Board of Charities. Of those who were informed of this
fact, very few indeed were acquainted with the specific abuses
which the comptroller's article exposes. To a few individuals, however,
who have devoted time and money unselfishly to the defense of
public interests and to the exposure of the evils of irresponsible
relief, these facts have long been familiar. Such can not fail to
take satisfaction in the clear presentation of the case by Mr. Coler.
Especially to the men and women who have been connected with the
work of the State Charities Aid Association and the Charity Organization
Society will Mr. Coler's article be welcome, as a strong re-enforcement
of arguments which they for years have been presenting
to the people of New York, oftentimes, it has seemed, to but
unwilling hearers.</p>

<p>It is therefore in no spirit of fundamental disagreement, but
rather in the desire to further the reform which the comptroller
demands, that I venture to criticise in two particulars the statement
as he has left it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an incomplete view of the enormously difficult problem of
charity which fails to set forth some of the reasons that have led
to the growth of an excessive faith in the excellence of private institutions
and in the wisdom of a co-operation between them and the
public, which is taken for granted when they receive appropriations
of public money.</p>

<p>Great as have been the abuses associated with private charity,
they are small when compared with the abuses that have existed in
the public administration of poor relief. As all familiar with the history
of this subject know, the old English poor law was so administered
in the rural parishes that paupers were in a more eligible position
than industrious farm laborers; that women with bastard children
were publicly rewarded for unchastity; and that, now and
again, rent-paying farmers were willing to surrender their lands to
the paupers to work them for what could be made, rather than to go
on paying rates. The exposure of the evils of the system, which was
made in the report of the famous Poor Law Commission appointed
in 1832, and the attempt to abolish them by the provisions of the
Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, ought to be studied by every
citizen who desires to perform his full duty as a guardian of public
interests, and especially by every individual whose sympathies
lead him to undertake any practical effort for the amelioration
of pauperism. In the United States, on account of the extremely
decentralized character of our poor-relief system generally,
we have no such impressive body of critical literature as
that which was brought out in England during the first half of the
present century. None the less, whenever special investigations
of the management of town and city relief administration and of
the management of almshouses have been made, deplorable abuses
have almost invariably been exposed, and individuals acquainted
with the facts have argued that any possible misdirection of either
private or public funds through private agencies could not equal
the corruption and the inhumanity for which officialism has been
responsible.</p>

<p>Let us look at one noteworthy example. In 1891 a special
committee appointed to report on outdoor alms in the town of Hartford,
Connecticut, discovered a state of affairs with which nothing
revealed in Mr. Coler's statements can for a moment be compared.
The general situation, the committee said, was found to be as
follows:</p>

<p>"In 1885 Hartford was paying $2.07 for each man, woman,
and child of its population in poor relief. New Haven was paying
$1.30; Bridgeport, $1.03; Waterbury, 81 cents; Norwich, $1.54;
New Britain, $1.39, etc.; for twelve Connecticut cities an average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
of $1.22 per capita against our $2.07; and with Hartford far ahead
of her nearest competitor. For outdoor relief the figures were
similar. Hartford, 90 cents per capita; New Haven, 51 cents; Norwalk,
23 cents, etc.&mdash;an average for the twelve of 61 cents per
capita, with only one higher, Hartford in the lead again by fifty
per cent. Five Massachusetts cities, including Boston, Worcester,
and Lowell, average $1.16 for all relief, against our $2.07; and 24
cents for outdoor relief against our 90 cents. Five other New England
cities, including Providence and Bangor, average 33 cents for
all relief, against our $2.07; and 12 cents for outdoor, against our
90 cents. Four New York cities&mdash;New York, Brooklyn, Buffalo,
and Albany&mdash;average 63 cents, against our $2.07; and 43 cents,
against our 90 cents. Five cities in Pennsylvania and Maryland,
including Philadelphia, Pittsburg, and Baltimore, average 38 cents
against our $2.07; and 4 cents, against our 90 cents. Seven Western
and Southern cities, including Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee,
and Charleston, average 62 cents for all relief, against our
$2.07; and 17 cents, against our 90 cents."</p>

<p>A similar comparison extended by the committee to the principal
cities of Europe, including Berlin, Dresden, and Stuttgart,
showed that here again Hartford led them all. In short, it appeared
to be proved that Hartford was spending on the poor more
money per capita of population than any other city in the United
States, and more than any other in the world, with certain exceptions
in Italy, and the noteworthy exceptions of London, $3.75 per
capita, and Paris, $3.66 per capita. Hartford, however, outranked
even London in its percentage of pauper population, which was 6.2
in Hartford, against 2.46 in London. While in Hartford every
sixteenth person was a recipient of municipal bounty, in London
the proportion was only one in forty. Paris led all, with one
in eight.</p>

<p>Investigation of the causes of this deplorable state of affairs
revealed an astonishing understanding between the paupers and the
officials. Tramps were given residence and support for the sake
of their votes on election day. Grocery stores were practically
subsidized. Families whose individual members could be made useful
politically were supported in outdoor relief.</p>

<p>That the showing was so much better for New York and other
great American cities was not a proof of greater honesty or wisdom
of administration on the part of municipal officials. The difference
was almost wholly due to the enormous extension of private
as over against public charity outside of typical New England Commonwealths
like Connecticut, where the town method of dealing
with such matters still holds its own against other forms of philanthropic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
enterprise. Proof on this point would be overwhelming
were we to take the necessary space to present it. One has only
to go through the annual reports of the New York State Board of
Charities and read the exposures that have repeatedly been made
of the state of affairs on the islands of the East River and in the
county almshouses of the State to satisfy himself that were the whole
burden of supporting the pauper population of this Commonwealth,
and especially of this city, thrown upon the public, private enterprise
withdrawing from the competition, the appropriations mentioned
by Mr. Coler would sink into ridiculous insignificance by
comparison. The appropriation of public money to private institutions
has become a scandalous abuse, but we shall never understand
its strength until we frankly face the fact that the public has
been experimenting with it, hoping thus to find a way of escape from
the greater abuses that attend the administration of public relief
by public agencies except when they are incessantly watched and
held up to the broadest light of publicity by the disinterested efforts
of private citizens.</p>

<p>The omission of this side of the matter from Mr. Coler's discussion
may perhaps be regarded as a mere failure to deal with the
whole of a very large and difficult problem. But it is more than
a mere omission; it is, I think, a positive error, and a serious one,
into which the comptroller falls when he lays as much stress as he
does upon the expenditure, for salaries and wages, of a large proportion
of the sums appropriated by the city for private institutions.
The real question here, as all sound experience has repeatedly demonstrated,
is not whether the expenditure is for salaries in general
rather than for relief. This Mr. Coler practically admits when he
says that a great deal of money spent for relief is worse than wasted,
because it fosters pauperism instead of repressing it, and when, at
the close of his article, he says that he found it necessary to create
in his department a bureau to investigate the character of institutions
asking aid. This is a frank confession that the expenditure of
money for salaries or for wages may be wiser than its expenditure
in relief, provided the salaries or wages are earned in actual investigation,
which results in exposing fraud and preventing expenditures
on improper applicants. This is the very kernel of the whole
matter, whether it is a private or a public administration of charity
that we are considering. The use of money, public or private, for
the payment of salaries that are mere sinecures is dishonesty pure
and simple, and neither the comptroller nor any of those private
organizations that make it their business to watch and criticise administration
can have a more imperative duty than that of putting
an end to such corruption. But, on the other hand, there could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
no better index of positive progress in solving the practical problems
of charity than a steady increase in the ratio of expenditures
in salaries and wages on account of investigation and prevention to
the amount spent in actual relief. That, in fact, would be an ideal
administration of public and private charities in which the efficiency
of investigators and the practical sagacity of relieving agents was
so high that nearly the whole sum expended had to be charged to
their salary account.</p>

<p>This is precisely the principle which private organizations like
the State Charities Aid Association and the Charity Organization
Society have labored in season and out of season to make the public
and the officials comprehend. Innumerable exposures of the impostures
practiced upon a credulous public by the great class of
professional mendicants, tramps, and place seekers have furnished
all the evidence that sensible men need to satisfy themselves that
large sums expended by the public and by private individuals of
charitable proclivities have no other result than that of encouraging
pauperism and misery. It is largely due to the tireless efforts of
the State Charities Aid Association for many years past that the
institutions receiving public moneys in this State have been watched
with such vigilance that there is now a strict system of accounting
in all of them, and that it has become the duty of the State Board
of Charities not only to insist upon such accounting and to carry out
a thorough inspection, but also to frame and enforce rules for their
government.</p>

<p>These criticisms I offer, however, only because, as I said at the
outset, I desire to see the fundamental proposition of Mr. Coler's
statement strengthened and made to bear practical fruit. It is indeed
a very serious question whether the appropriation of public
money to private institutions has not become so great an evil that
it would be better to put a stop to it once for all. And yet I must
confess to a doubt whether, upon a complete survey of all the facts,
this would be the judgment of the most practical and far-seeing men.
The granting of appropriations gives to the city and the State a reason
and an excuse for a strict inspection of organizations that otherwise
might do incalculable mischief by preying upon the credulity
of a generous public while concealing their actual operations. I
therefore am inclined to think that the path of practical wisdom
lies through an attempt to perfect the existing co-operation between
public and private agencies, and to bring it to a sounder business
basis by developing inspection, publicity, and accountability. If
private organizations are encouraged to do all in their own power
under a system wherein the State grants them aid under strict conditions,
lays down necessary rules for their government and guidance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
and remorselessly exposes all their transactions, the actual
result may be better in the long run than if State and private associations
proceeded independently of one another, often duplicating
each other's work, or, if not that, working at cross-purposes.</p>

<h2>RECENT LEGISLATION AGAINST THE DRINK EVIL.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By APPLETON MORGAN.</span></p>


<p>Five years ago it was sought in these pages<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to discover the
cause or causes of the total failure in the United States of
prohibitive legislation.</p>

<p>Our conclusion, so far as a conclusion could be said to have been
reached, was that the failure lay in the misapplication of ways to
means, rather than of means to ends&mdash;namely, that an attempt to
abolish the crime (or misdemeanor) of drunkenness by punishing, not
the criminal, but the community in which he committed the crime,
and to prevent law-breaking by legislating out of existence the neutral
instrument which happened to form the particular temptation to
the particular law-breaker (or with which he found it convenient to
commit the crime), was quite too logical to be practicable; as, for
instance, laws abolishing the use of spoons, as so many temptations
to housebreakers; or of railways, because trespassers on railway
tracks were often killed; or steamboats, because steamboat boilers
sometimes burst, would be quite too logical for public convenience.
Whence it followed that there was no demand for prohibitive liquor
laws, and therefore only failure had resulted from attempting to
enforce them.</p>

<p>In the five years since that paper was printed almost every one
of the United States (in fact, all, with but one exception) have recognized
such failure and striven to so recast each its statutes as
to plant the responsibility for breach of public order upon the real
offender without hardship to the law-abiding classes. The results
of these attempts have evolved many novel and unusual contrivances
and much curious operation of statutory and statistical wisdom,
and some remarkable propositions&mdash;so much so that it is
believed that an effort to digest them (not by States, but by the principles,
or rather by the remedies, attempted) will be interesting consideration
for readers of the Popular Science Monthly. If the following
summary shall develop two apparent paradoxes&mdash;first, that
the fewer the places where liquor is sold the larger the consumption
of liquor; and, second, that the larger the consumption of liquor the
less drunkenness&mdash;the present writer can only submit that these paradoxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
are not his own, but seem to arise from the official statistics submitted
under the oaths of the authorities commissioned to collect
them, as hereinafter will more fully appear:</p>

<p>Of the forty-nine States and Territories in the United States, the
solitary exception above noted is the State of Maine. With a heroism
that is actual martyrdom of self-interest and convenience,
the State of Maine has clung with imperious tenacity to her policy
of absolute prohibition, and to the logic of the report of her citizen,
who, sixty-three years ago, carried her first prohibition law
through her Legislature. Said that report: "The objection will
doubtless be made that had we such a law it could not be enforced.
Now, admit the validity of this objection, and it proves the utter
hopelessness of the case; for no one, we presume, will venture the
supposition that you can accomplish, against law, that which you
could not effect with it."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Admitting, as all the world does admit, that the abolition of
drunkenness is desirable, against such pitiless, such iron, logic as this,
there is no appeal, and from it there is no escape even to-day. But
the trouble was, and is, that it is placing an entire Commonwealth
in time of peace under martial law. It was in the fitness of things
that General Appleton, a soldier, who had seen intoxication in a
form most likely to impress him with dangers to the public&mdash;i. e., in
soldiers to whom the safety of the State in time of war was intrusted&mdash;should
have brought in the first prohibition law on record;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and that, in the teeth of more than two generations of failure, the
sovereign State of Maine should have adhered to his martial logic,
with the loss of her commerce and the reduction of her census, is
a tribute to both the logic of a soldier or the self-insistence of the
State which must compel admiration! In sixty-three years Maine
has seen her commerce disappear and her population dwindle. She
has seen not only her contemporary sister States, but those admitted
yesterday and the day before, pass her in affluence and prosperity.
But the only remedy for her failure she will listen to the suggestion
of is an increased severity of prohibition statutes and an increased
crucifixion of her law-abiding citizens, lest one of her own or a
single stranger within her gates should obtain a glass of alcoholic
compound within her borders.</p>

<p>But, cling as the State of Maine may to the fierce logic of prohibition,
it appears that her forty-eight sisters have found its unappealable
rigor too rigid, and have modulated it in the diverse ways now
to be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p>In these remaining forty-eight States and Territories of the Union
the statistics regulating liquor seem to divide themselves, as to the
remedies attempted, into ten heads, as follows:</p>

<p>I. Abolish all liquor laws except those for revenue.</p>

<p>II. Example.</p>

<p>III. Education.</p>

<p>IV. Government control of all warehousing and sales.</p>

<p>V. Regulation of hours for retailing liquors.</p>

<p>VI. Refusal of employment to drinkers. Change of pay-day.</p>

<p>VII. Personal damage law.</p>

<p>VIII. Encourage the use of light wines and beers; remove all
duties or imposts on food products; quality inspection.</p>

<p>IX. High revenue&mdash;national, interstate, or State.</p>

<p>X. Local option.</p>

<p>For No. I, pure and simple, we have but a single report, perhaps
(as of a frontier State) not exemplary, or safe to guide the more interior
States, but given exactly for what it may be worth. The
Governor of Montana (a State which boasts the bad eminence of
having proportionately more liquor-sellers paying license fees than
any other State in the Union&mdash;having, in fact, one licensed liquor-seller
to every fifty-five inhabitants) reports as follows:</p>

<p>"Saloons are run wide open night and day; while there is a
great deal of drinking there is very little drunkenness, and one in
an intoxicated condition is promptly arrested and fined." One other
State, however (Louisiana), has the continental idea that liquor laws
are for "revenue only." Louisiana, therefore, has an elaborate excise,
guiltless of any suggestion of reformative objects. So far as
her statistics go, she is the most temperate State in the Union.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;This may be called the apostolic cure&mdash;the one
laid down by the apostle St. Paul (I Corinthians, viii, 13)&mdash;though
we find a prominent English ecclesiastic, Dean Hole, on being asked
if he was not aware that people ought to abstain for the sake of
their example to others, replied: "I have never seen any one converted
by example. I have often challenged teetotalers to produce
Mr. Jones converted by the example of Mr. Brown, but I am waiting
for him. I don't see why I should make a fool of myself because
others do." I should not deal with the matter quite so summarily
myself. Doubtless the example of a thrifty, wholesome, prosperous
laborer, if left (without exhortation or impertinence of third
parties) to work upon his dram-drinking, wretched neighbor, might
have its laudable effect: such example not being deprived in advance
of its value by the fetters of a written pledge which a man's personal
pride might force him to ostentatiously observe&mdash;or if the exemplary
person does not get his living by denouncing liquor&mdash;or by the coercion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
of a Ladies' Temperance Union! But as the person converted by
the example would be certain not to parade the fact, no statistics
could even then be attainable. The case or cases, if genuine, would
be hidden in the consciences of the converts and beyond any marshaling
in figures. All we can do is to hope and trust that our good
examples may prevail, and that, like the apostle St. Paul (whom our
British ecclesiastic begs to differ with), there may be some among
us strong enough physically as well as spiritually to say, "If meat
make my brother to offend, I will eat no meat while the world
standeth."</p>

<p>These considerations have not, however, deterred certain States
from ingrafting example upon the statute-book, as nearly as it could
be made a subject of legislation, by enacting that there shall be held
before the eye of the possible drinker the spectacle of his neighbors
drinking rum: trusting, doubtless, to the rum itself to work a
condition in the drinker to afford the example required, and so add
to the unestimated but hoped-for good example to bad example at
hand. Three States&mdash;i. e., Indiana, Michigan, and Utah&mdash;and the
city of Atlanta, Georgia, by municipal ordinance, provide that the
premises on which liquor is retailed by drinks shall have no screen or
other obstruction before its windows, so that passers-by may see the
drinking which goes on therein and its horrible accompanying circumstances.
The reports from these States, however, are not such
as to commend this policy of example to universal acceptance.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Education.</span>&mdash;Within the past four years several States&mdash;Wisconsin,
Ohio, New Jersey, Nevada&mdash;have enacted statutes providing
that pupils in the public schools should be particularly instructed
in so much at least of the science of toxicology as relates
to the uses and abuses of alcohol, and of its effect upon the human
system. Such instruction, if honestly imparted by capable teachers
and by honest text-books, can not fail to be of the highest value.
Capable teachers and honest text-books could not possibly teach, for
example, that alcoholic liquors were an unmixed evil, could not deny
their medicinal value, or their stimulative aid in fortifying against
disease or exposure, or in supplying the waste of age; could not teach
(as I gave instances of of fanatical teachings) that it were better to
die for the need of a glass of whisky than to have one's life saved
by the use of it, or that the use of liquor "destroys both body and
soul" (in the teeth of the facts that only the most flagrant and protracted
abuse of liquor ever, and that after a long term of years, destroyed
a human body, and that statistics as to the soul are not
attainable). Much is to be hoped for under this benign instruction.
It is not possible that our youth will not miss to acquire much important
information, such as that "wine is a good servant if well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
used"; that total abstinence is a regimen only to be pursued by advice
of a physician; that the vast majority of human beings can and
do partake moderately of alcoholic liquors, not only without injurious
consequences, but with positive benefit; and that, as it is a source
of much enjoyment, and much discomfort often springs from its discontinuance,
it is difficult to say why such use should be discontinued
under ordinary circumstances. Our youth will learn, too, that there
are many nations that thrive without alcoholic drinks&mdash;nations, for
example, professing the Mohammedan faith, to whom alcohol is forbidden
by their religion; but that among them the use of stronger
narcotics, such as opium and Indian hemp, is extremely common,
and the exchange from alcohol to these narcotics can hardly be
looked upon as a gain. The result of this State instruction may be
confidently looked for, and can not possibly do harm. It is too early
as yet to procure data for discussion of the amount of good accomplished
by this legislation. We must wait until the adolescent pupil
has grown to man's estate, to middle age, until his mortal change,
and search his record, and the record of the family he leaves behind
him, for the benefits of the paternal legislation. In short, it is exceedingly
doubtful if data upon this subject, in the nineteenth century
at least, will ever be collected at all. It is noticeable, however,
that in the States' scheme of education the peripatetic temperance
lecturer, with his lurid colored charts of the human stomach
in the horrors of suffering from what he calls "the flowin' bowl,"
have no place, and no salary is provided for such "university extension"
processes. A suggestion lately made in these pages that
temperance lecturers as well as liquor dealers being obliged to take
out licenses (at least as caterers to the public amusement) is conspicuous
by its absence from the educational plan.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Government Control of Traffic.</span>&mdash;The idea of a government
monopoly in liquor is from continental Europe, and, like
most ideas from that source, is paternal and monarchical pure and
simple. The idea reached perfection in what is known as the Gothenburg
system, which, attracting considerable attention from students
of the liquor problem, was introduced into the statutes of
Georgia, where after a brief trial it was discarded. The State of
South Carolina, however, adopted its principal features, calling it
the "dispensary system," and is still maintaining it.</p>

<p>The story of the Gothenburg system is as follows: Since the
days of Gustavus Adolphus III there had existed in Sweden and Norway
a policy making the distillation of a liquor called <i>br&auml;nxin</i>, or
brandy, a right running with the ownership of land first, afterward
with a tenancy of land, and ultimately a right secured to tavern-keepers.
This brandy being distilled from grain or potatoes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
containing about fifty per cent of alcohol, was cheap, and in consequence
of the poor food supply grew into universal use, until not
only men and women but very young children drank it. Drunkenness
became the rule, and pauperism and crime prevailed in startling
proportions, outrunning the range of either charity or police to
control them. In this state of affairs a Dr. Wisselgren, Dean of
Gothenburg, a Swedish city, arose, and from his exertions grew the
famous Gothenburg system.</p>

<p>Stripped of detail, this system provides that stock companies
called brandy companies shall receive from the crown a monopoly
of liquor sales, on condition of maintaining eating houses, reading
rooms, lodgings, and other conveniences for the community, and out
of surplus profits contribute to the police, the poor, and the educational,
funds of the community. The companies shall be under inspection
of the royal governor, with no appeal from his discretion,
and also under inspection of officers of the three funds entitled to
the surplus profits. The companies must close their places of sale
on Sundays, can sell only to persons over eighteen years of age, and
in the rooms devoted to drinking alone there must be no chairs or
settees. After drinking, the purchaser must depart. Such rooms
must not be in communication directly with the eating and lodging
rooms. In these latter cleanliness and cheapness must prevail, but
the company may raise the price and dilute the strength of the
brandy sold.</p>

<p>With much amendment and revision, this system appears to be
to-day substantially in effect, with what good results opinions differ.
It was speedily rejected after brief trial in Georgia for a high-license
system pure and simple. In South Carolina its introduction
from Georgia provoked riot and even bloodshed on account of
the right of search which it involved. The main feature is, of course,
that the State becomes the real buyer, jobber, and retailer of all
ardent spirits. Here it has been found difficult of complete administration,
and, unless its success should be more distinguished
than at present, it probably is but a short-lived expedient.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Regulation of Hours of Sale.</span>&mdash;All the liquor-licensing
States and Territories regulate the hours of opening and closing
drinking places. They all agree in closing them during the small
hours (that is, from midnight or one o'clock <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> until about sunrise
or an hour after). It is difficult to all what effect for good or
ill these statutes can have upon either the decrease of drunkenness
or the increase of revenue. Doubtless they are convenient for the
public force of cities or the constabulary of the smaller towns, so that
they may know when to be prepared for possible breaking of the
public peace. But in no State, so far as we can discover, are they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
applied to Sunday, the day when, in large cities especially, and in
the heated season, the inconvenience of hermetically closed ale and
beer houses is most exasperating to the wayfarer, and intolerable
and even (from a sanitary standpoint) dangerous to the wage-earning
and poorer classes, packed in torrid and fetid tenements on the
figment of a danger of "disturbing a public worship" (I say "figment"
because no instance of a disturbance of public worship by the
sale of liquor can be found in the history of this planet). Why in
torrid weather the worthy poor man and his family who can not
afford ice-boxes can not quench a natural and normal thirst, and so
avoid contracting disease by drinking stale and impure water in
the superheated apartments of city tenement houses where an average
of three families to a window pane has been said to be the rule,
I for one have never been able to comprehend. A good Sunday
law, as in London, not allowing but compelling the opening of beer
houses on certain hours on Sundays, would be a most desirable thing,
especially in our great cities. The fact, too, that at present the
streets of our American cities are woefully lacking in other sanitary
conveniences, which are only supplied meagerly by an occasional
drinking place, would appear an additional reason why a Sunday-opening
law would be quite as convenient and quite as welcome as a
Sunday-closing law. Such a law would have the effect of at least
meeting public convenience, and might well be substituted for the
present ridiculous closing laws. Into what legislative intellect it
ever first entered to conceive that the cause of temperance would
be assisted by closing liquor saloons seven hours out of the twenty-four
(and those seven the hours when all Nature, drunk or sober, is
asleep) it passes imagination to conjecture. Most Legislatures have
followed the first one, however, and enacted such provisions.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Refusal of Employment to Persons known to be Habitual
Users of Liquor.</span>&mdash;In two States&mdash;viz., New York and Ohio&mdash;clauses
have been introduced forbidding the employment by railways
and other common carriers of passengers, of persons known
to be addicted to the use of intoxicants. In the latter State the
common carrier must be notified that such person has been known
to be intoxicated while in said carrier's "active" employment,
in order to bind the carrier with knowledge. Such a provision
as this may be criticised as the Czar of Russia's proposition for a
universal disarmament is likely to be criticised&mdash;as admirable and
millennial, but of no value if gradually adopted, and impossible of
instant adoption. No public industry, not even the liquor industry,
could cease and disappear in a day without throwing tens of thousands
of wage-earners out of employment, and it would be hardship
indeed if the family of the drinking man, the toiling wife, scheming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
to save a morsel of the weekly wages from the dram shop, should be
forced to accept the alternative of no wages at all. The suggestion
presents, again, a maze of presumption from which, once entered
into, no practical exit would present itself. Supposing that no skilled
laborer, no finisher, no engineer, no oiler, no fireman, etc., could
be found who was a total abstainer for any one factory or railway
service, let alone a hundred or a hundred thousand cases? Clearly
this discussion could only be pursued as a curiosity (or, say, a fascinating
speculation as to the effects of an industrial chaos). The first
item in the recipe for making hare stew was to catch your hare.
To run our commerce with totally abstaining employees we must find
our totally abstaining employees. To pause to create them would
bring commerce, and with it society, including the churches, the
schools, and the Temperance Unions themselves, to a standstill like
that of Joshua's moon in Ajalon! In connection with this employment
question, however, a practical suggestion has been made. It
is suggested that, as Saturday night is the workman's "night off"
and the ensuing Sunday is his holiday, it might work well to make
the weekly pay-day of a Monday instead of a Saturday. The experiment
is worth a trial. The change could be made abruptly, and
the bad half an hour to the workman would occur but once. Let
him be handed his wages some Monday morning when the Saturday
night's spree and the long Sunday's headache had been novel and
conspicuous omissions. The necessity of good shape for Tuesday's
stint would prevent a Monday night at the bar room, and the probability
is that the wife and family might realize a substantial instead
of a marginal proportion of the weekly wage. At any rate, compared
with some of the suggestions made for remedying the drink
evil, this is superbly sensible. Indeed, one who has not had occasion
to examine these matters can have little idea of the absurdity
to which otherwise perfectly sane persons will go in combating an
evil with which they are very properly impressed, but to the consequences
of an abrupt removal of which it has not occurred to them to
pay any attention whatever; for example, the seriously proposed
law against "treating"&mdash;that is, against inviting a friend to "take
a drink" with him. Granted that the tippling habit is encouraged
by the social instinct, and that the great peril of drunkenness comes
(as an old New England farmer expressed it) "not from drinkin',
but from drinkin' agin," a law to prevent treating, like a law forbidding
a man from inviting his neighbor home to dinner, or his
wife inviting the other man's wife over to luncheon, would be obliged
to first find its lawgiver. But gentlemen who solve the liquor question
are not apt to be particular to find a jurisdiction and a source
for the laws they propose. It is interesting to note that in one State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
(Nevada) an anti-treating law was once actually passed, but repealed,
"having proved impracticable" (at least, that is the official record
of the reason for its repeal, no particulars being given).</p>

<p>VII. <span class="smcap">The Personal Damage Law.</span>&mdash;that is, the holding of a
seller of liquor to a person known to be dangerous when in drink responsible
for damage caused by his intoxication. This principle has
now become ingrafted in the laws of seventeen of the United States,
sometimes coupled with high license and local option and sometimes
not. It is really only an application of the principle of the common
law that a man must so use his own as not to injure his neighbor;
that communities had the same right to hold a supplier of intoxicants
to a violent drinker as a criminal as it had to punish the keeper of
a dangerous beast (of a biting dog, for example, knowing it to be
such&mdash;i. e., if the animal has once bitten a human being or killed a
domestic animal kept for revenue, as a cow or a sheep). This civil
damage law has been made statutory in many ways. In Ohio the
seller is held indefinitely for the "expenses of any one who takes
charge of the intoxicated person" after notice to the seller not to
sell to that person. In Michigan the damages may be exemplary.
In Vermont, if the drunkard is imprisoned the seller must pay two
dollars per day to his wife or minor children in addition to suffering
an imprisonment. In New Hampshire and Nebraska, and in several
other States, a person arrested for drunkenness is given his
liberty if he will disclose the name of the person who sold him the
liquor on which he became intoxicated. In most of the other States
(as in New York) the damages are not limited except by the facts
of such case. In New York, too, the preliminary notice is insisted
on. In other States (as Idaho) the seller's damage is the loss of his
license, if notice not to sell has been properly served upon him. In
Arkansas the liquor seller as a condition of his license must give a
bond to pay all damages awarded. In Nebraska the seller must
give a bond to support all widows and orphans, and pay all legal
expenses of prosecution as well as all damage resulting from any
intoxication induced by or traceable to his sales.</p>

<p>VIII. <span class="smcap">Encourage the Use of Light Wines and Beers.</span>&mdash;The
suggestion has often been made that this would undoubtedly solve
at one swoop a respectable proportion of the problem. The practical
difficulty would be to institute the reform in any but the cities
and larger towns. Everybody has remarked that, to see the true and
distinguished squalor of drunkenness, one must seek the villages,
sparsely settled communities, the rural districts whence come the
"come-ons," the willing victims of the green-goods men, anxious to
cheat their Government (and so, one might say, at least a shade less
estimable than the sharper who only proposes to cheat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
fellow-citizen). It seems to me that the reason for this difference lies distinctly
in the fact that the countryman, who will gratify his appetite
for drink, has no choice but the concoction of ardent spirits, high
wines, or whatever it is which the local publican sets before him. To
him the word "wine" suggests a luxury beyond his venture or his
purse. And so for the price at which, in a large city, he could obtain
half a bottle, or even a bottle, of wholesome red wine, the consumption
of which at a settling would do no possible harm, he throws
into his stomach a glass of biting poison, and, horrible to relate,
another and another; whereas the whole bottle, or at least the half
bottle, probably shared with a neighbor, would have satisfied his
craving without ruining his digestion or stealing away his brains.
This clause of our discussion runs largely into our IX. But meanwhile
here are some figures which may startle prohibitionists as
completely as did the figures given in these pages four years ago,
which went to prove that habitual drunkards lived longer than total
abstainers. (These figures have been strenuously denied in declamation
and denouncement. I have yet to learn that any attempt has
been made by industry in collection of counter-figures to demonstrate
their fallacy.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>) But here are certain other figures: It appears by
the official report of Dr. Nagle to the Health Department of the
city of New York for the first thirty-one weeks of the year 1893
(the city then prior to the consolidation or to the present "Raines"
law) that in the community (as it then was of 1,765,645 inhabitants)
out of 29,080 deaths only twenty-nine were directly traceable
to the use of liquor. And this in a community where 10,749
liquor saloons were in operation from sunrise to midnight daily, not
to mention the use of wines and liquors in hundreds of hotels and
clubs and of wines and malt liquors on tens of thousands of private
tables. These figures are startling, and read quite as extravagantly
as those quite to the reverse conclusion with which the prohibitionists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
are wont to appall us. But they are from the official sources, and,
unlike the awful figures which show a larger mortality from the use
of liquor alone than the mortality from all known causes (liquor
included), can be verified by taking the trouble to consult the files
of the (New York) City Record. As for the part which drinking
wine has to do with this official summary, I may mention the difficulty
of approximating to the sales of what may be properly called "light
wines." But I have been able to ascertain (as some indication of
it, perhaps) that in the fifty-two weeks of this same year (1893) there
were consumed in the same city 265,414 cases of champagne! So it
would appear that even champagne is a mitigant, rather than an
aggravator, of at least the public horrors of drunkenness.</p>

<p>I am not unconscious of the fluent answer to these figures. It
will be of course urged by the prohibitionist that they only show
deaths the "direct" cause of dram-drinking. But such answer is
correspondingly unsafe. For, since death, albeit normal to us all
comes from some cause (notably from old age, for example), a better
formula would be that, since many deaths are caused by old age,
and as old age is caused by living too long, we should be careful
not to live too long. Hence, as life is prolonged by eating, as well
as shortened by drinking (granting that contention), to abstain from
the use of food is the only course of wisdom!</p>

<p>This encouragement to the drinking of light wines has, so far,
only positively found its way into the statute-books of the one essentially
wine-growing State, California, though in other States it has
made its limited appearance. Nor does there seem to be any reason
why every State should not include in its laws such a provision, for
example, as that of Oregon (certainly not known as <i>per se</i> a "wine-growing
State" at present), which provides that "owners of vineyards
may sell their products without license"; or of Utah, which,
however, adds to a similar provision that the sale must be in quantities
not less than five gallons. Even Kansas provides that wine or
cider, grown by the maker for his own use or to be sold for communion
purposes, is not within the prohibitions. However, as in
most of the States, the price of a license to sell only wines, or wines
and beers, is less than the price of a license to sell ardent spirits, it
may fairly be said that an encouragement to drinking wines in preference
to distilled liquors has become parcel of the public policy in
most communities. In Georgia the sellers of wines who are also
manufacturers thereof are exempted from paying any license. The
State of Michigan is justly proud of its Dairy and Food Commission,
which provides for the examination and secures the purity not only
of fruits, butter, milk, cheese, but of buckwheat flour, jellies, canned
goods, lard, vinegar, coffee, sirups and molasses, chocolate, cocoanuts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
baking powder, flavoring extracts, mustard, and other spices. And
this same law (elsewhere considered as to adulteration of liquors)
seems to encourage light wines by a distinct provision that "the blending
of liquors will be permitted if spirits or other ingredients are not
added." In Rhode Island, if manufactured from fruit or grain
grown in the State, no license is required for the manufacture of
cider, wine, or malt liquors; and (with a thrift not uncharacteristic)
alcohol, while subject to a heavy license for home consumption, may
be produced for exportation without any license at all.</p>

<p>IX. <span class="smcap">Remove all Duties, Taxes, Imposts, or Burdens of any
Sort on Food Products, Serials, or Meats</span>, in order that the food
supply may be unfailing everywhere.</p>

<p>Ten years ago the Hon. Edwin Reed, of Boston, Massachusetts,
published a pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in which he had the courage to say that,
if a man were well fed, liquor could have no terrors for him. "Take
care of the eating and the drinking will take care of itself." Repeal
all laws that in any degree and on any pretext tend to enhance the
market prices, was Mr. Reed's thesis, and he nailed it boldly to the
Massachusetts State-House door! Mr. Reed proceeded with figures
to remind us that the countries where drunkenness existed to the most
alarming degrees were those countries where the masses of the people
eat the least, see meat perhaps once or twice a year, and perhaps
never; where the year's labor barely suffices to pay the year's taxes!&mdash;in
Italy, Russia, or Sweden, and parts of Germany, for example,
where life is a struggle for bread enough to keep life in the body.
The figures Mr. Reed gives are too appalling for an Anglo-Saxon to
read calmly. "If Russia," says Mr. Reed, "could reduce her infant
mortality to that of Great Britain she would save annually a million
of lives. Half the Russian mothers can not nurse their children.
The whip and spur of poverty drives them to labor in the fields, where
they follow the plow three days after confinement, and where the
death rate is forty-eight per thousand.... In France many a factory
hand lives on a slice of sour bread for a meal, over which he is
fortunate if he can rub an onion to give it flavor.... In Italy,
where taxes are imposed to twenty-five per cent of the laborer's income,
the average length of life is twenty-seven years, and the whole
kingdom is mortgaged to an average of seventeen per cent." In
W&uuml;rtemberg Mr. Reed assures us that "in this garden of Germany
the peasant lives on black bread and potatoes with meat only once
a year." And even in England Mr. Reed (quoting his authority)
declares that the collier breakfasts on bread soaked in hot water and
flavored with onion, dines on bread and hard cheese, with sour, thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
cider, and sups on potatoes or cabbage greased with a bit of bacon
rind. And precisely the identical testimony, varying only the
staples of starvation, comes from Switzerland, Poland, and other
countries. Now, all this requires something, and that something
usually takes the form of something alcoholic. Poor Edgar Allan
Poe produced his fascinating prose and marvelous poetry on dinners
of herbs, and the well-fed, fat, greasy Honey-thunders and Podsnaps
recognize the crime, not in the fact that such a man was left to eat
such dinners, but that he took a glass of whisky to keep the life in
his poor unnourished body while he wrote. Therefore Mr. Reed
would make food as plentiful as Nature has enabled man to make it.
In other words, a condition of unfedness requires the human system
to crave alcoholic stimulants, and what the human system craves
it must find, since the craving becomes functional, and impossible
to disregard, <i>malgre</i> laws, systems, or statutes whatsoever. Even
the children in Switzerland, says Dr. Schuler (quoted by Mr. Reed),
are fed whisky between meals in order to sustain their tiny lives, the
low regimen of whose mothers has given them the frailest possible
hold on life to live at all. Mr. Reed believes also that, on public
grounds, other effort for amelioration should be made by the State,
such as shorter hours of labor, two holidays a week, etc. But as to
these we will not follow him here. He makes his point, however,
and his pamphlet is worth the consideration of philanthropists. It
can not be denied that, with the exception of the shorter hours for
labor and the general tendency to increase the number of holidays
("Labor Day," Arbor Day, Memorial Day, Lincoln Day, etc.), much
of Mr. Reed's theories have got into our statute-books. And the
general tendency to ameliorate the condition of the laborer, which
is everywhere apparent in the United States, may fairly be alluded
to here as among statutory efforts to the universal betterment.</p>

<h2>TEACHERS' SCHOOL OF SCIENCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> FRANCES ZIRNGIEBEL.</p>


<p>"He who would most effectually improve school tuition must
find out the most effectual way of improving the teachers.
Hence he is the greatest educational benefactor who does most to
raise the character and qualifications of the teachers," said John
D. Philbrick, late superintendent of the public schools of the city
of Boston, in his twenty-third semiannual report. By providing
teachers with the best instruction on subjects the teaching of which
was at the time of making this report, and is still, unsatisfactory,
The Teachers' School of Science of the Boston Society of Natural
History has for nearly three decades been a great educational benefactor.
It stands unique as an institution which, while doing a
great work for many years,
has presented nothing of
startling nature such as would
attract the attention of the
general public, and is therefore
not so widely known as
it deserves to be.</p>

<p>During a conversation
held at the council room of
the Boston Society of Natural
History, in 1870, between
Prof. Alpheus Hyatt and the
late Mr. John C. Cummings,
a Boston merchant interested
in natural history and curator
of the plant collection of the
society for twenty odd years,
the latter expressed regret
that the Lowell lectures for
teachers had been discontinued.
Professor Hyatt then
suggested to him a plan for lectures for teachers exclusively. That
afternoon Mr. Cummings gave five hundred dollars for the commencement
of such a course, and soon after the matter was brought
before a committee consisting of Mr. Cummings, Professor Hyatt,
and Professor Niles.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">John Cummings.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Under the direction of the committee the courses of lessons
were given as follows: physical geography, by Prof. William H.
Niles, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; mineralogy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
by Mr. W. C. Greenough, of the Providence Normal School; zo&ouml;logy,
by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, then custodian of the Boston Society
of Natural History; botany, by Dr. W. G. Farlow, of Cambridge&mdash;in
all thirty-three lessons.
These courses were wholly
tentative and experimental,
but attained success that was
most encouraging.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of
Professor Runkle, President
of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Huntington
Hall, in which so many
great scientists have spoken,
was opened for the first lesson
in geography. Professor
Niles here delivered six
lectures. "He undertook to
give the more general features
of the earth's surface,
and then to apply these general
principles to the explanation
of the physical characteristics
of Massachusetts."
The success of this course may be judged by the average attendance,
which was about six hundred teachers of all grades, and by
the fact that the teaching of geography in some of the public schools
at once underwent a change in favor of the more natural method
introduced by him.</p>

</div>

<p>"On account of the necessity of actually handling and dissecting
specimens, the tickets issued for the succeeding lessons were
limited, and at the six lessons on mineralogy and eleven on zo&ouml;logy
there was an average attendance of about fifty-five. The materials
for the course in zo&ouml;logy were gathered in sufficient abundance
through the extraordinary facilities for collecting marine animals
afforded by Prof. S. F. Baird, United States Commissioner of Fisheries;
those for the course in botany were furnished with equal readiness
and generosity by Prof. Asa Gray from his botanical garden
at Cambridge."</p>

<p>The society's attempt to introduce natural history into the public
schools met with favor at the hands of the superintendent, Mr.
Philbrick, and a committee of school principals was appointed, with
Mr. James A. Page as chairman, who canvassed the teachers regarding
this matter. Accordingly, in October, 1871, a circular was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
sent to teachers which said that lessons were to be given by "professors
familiar with the object methods of teaching and skillful in
the use of chalk." Seven hundred teachers signed this circular,
and so signified their pleasure at the prospect of receiving such
instruction.</p>

<p>While Mr. Cummings was generously providing these courses
of lectures exclusively for the benefit of teachers, Mr. John A.
Lowell, trustee of the Lowell Institute Fund, made liberal provision
for free courses on different branches of natural science, to
which teachers were specially invited and which were well adapted
to their wants, although not intended exclusively for them. During
the winter of 1872-'73, on account of the large fire in Boston
and the absence of Professor Hyatt in Europe, the lessons in The
Teachers' School of Science were necessarily suspended. In the
autumn of 1874 they were resumed and supported by renewed donations
from Mr. Cummings. Mr. L. S. Burbank gave thirty lessons
on minerals, and distributed the specimens used at the lectures
among the teachers. These minerals were then used in the schools
for instruction. This was virtually the introduction of the teaching
of natural science in the public schools of Boston. The following
winter Mr. Burbank continued his teaching by giving fourteen
lessons in lithology to a class averaging ninety in attendance.
One hundred sets of seventy-five specimens each were distributed,
and many of these sets placed in collections of the city schools. "A
supplementary course of field lessons about Boston was voluntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
conducted by Mr. Burbank, who had in his class this year seventy-five
per cent of the members of the class in mineralogy of the previous
year. This class included a large number of the busiest teachers
of Boston and vicinity, and each member of the class was provided
with tools, consisting of a small hammer, magnet, file, streak
stone of Arkansas quartzite, a bottle of dilute acid, a glass rod, and
the scale of hardness previously used in the mineralogical course."</p>

<p>In 1876 women were admitted to the Society of Natural History,
and in that way further privileges were granted to teachers.
As in previous years, through the liberality of Mr. Cummings, the
lessons were continued, and a course of twenty-one lessons in morphological,
physiological, and systematic botany was given by Prof.
George L. Goodale, of Harvard University. Each lesson was illustrated
by specimens which were distributed to the students. The
analysis of the flowers and the determination of the peculiarities
of floral structure were considered by Professor Goodale an important
part of the course. For this purpose blank forms were distributed
to the teachers, which enabled each one to pursue his examination
of the flower in hand independently, and made it possible
for the instructor to cover more ground than would have been
practical by any other method. There was an unusually large
attendance at these lessons, averaging one hundred. The following
year Professor Goodale continued to teach in the school, giving
twenty lectures on the principles of systematic botany. Printed
synopses of the lectures were placed in the hands of the teachers,
and nearly all the large orders of plants were illustrated by specimens
or diagrams. The teachers were also provided with dried
and named specimens of native plants suitable for private herbaria.
About one hundred and fifty sets of these plants were distributed
during the course, at which the attendance was even greater than
that of the previous year.</p>

<p>It was at this time that, through the efforts of Miss Lucretia
Crocker, the study of zo&ouml;logy was introduced into the high schools
of Boston, and the study of Nature in the public schools took a definite
form. At this time The Teachers' School of Science attained
an extraordinary size and importance, a development which was
sudden and unexpected. The supervisor of Nature study, Miss
Crocker, assured the directors of the school that their assistance
would be of great benefit, and in fact essential, to the success of the
introduction of this subject into the schools. It was therefore determined
to institute appropriate courses upon elementary botany,
zo&ouml;logy, and mineralogy, if the means of paying the expenses could
be raised. Mrs. S. T. Hooper and Miss Crocker undertook a considerable
amount of the necessary work, and fortunately their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
scheme met with substantial appreciation from Mrs. Augustus Hemmenway,
who subscribed most liberally, and they were assured of
further support and interest. Obstacles arose on account of the
number of applicants and the necessity of providing identical specimens
for all. The association and sympathy of Mrs. Elizabeth
Agassiz with the undertaking was particularly gratifying, since
Prof. Louis Agassiz was the first naturalist who ever taught the
popular audiences in this country with the specimens in hand.
Large sums of money were contributed by women, many members
of the Natural History Society, and the teachers themselves joined
in making up the necessary fund. The Institute of Technology
generously gave the use of
Huntington Hall upon the
payment of a nominal sum
for cleaning and heating.
Count Pourtal&eacute;s, Dr. Hermann
Hagan, and Mr. E. C.
Hamlin, of the Museum of
Comparative Zo&ouml;logy, which
was under the direction of
Mr. Alexander Agassiz, at
various times assisted by
donations from their respective
departments. Further assistance
in various ways, such
as the drawing of zo&ouml;logical
charts, preparations of models,
and donations of specimens,
was received from
other persons. There were
six hundred and sixteen applicants
for this winter's
course, and the number of specimens distributed did not fall short
of one hundred thousand. After an introductory lecture, at which
the Superintendent of Public Schools, the President of the Society
of Natural History, and the custodian, delivered addresses appropriate
to the occasion, Professor Goodale completed a course of six
lessons on botany, in which he instructed the whole audience of five
hundred. These lessons were followed the same year by twelve on
zo&ouml;logy by Professor Hyatt, and five on mineralogy by Mr. Burbank,
which ended with a geological excursion to Marblehead. These
lessons were given to very large classes, and were supplemented by
the issuing of pamphlets under the general title of Science Guides.
Three numbers&mdash;About Pebbles, by Professor Hyatt; A Few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
Common Plants, by Dr. Goodale; and Commercial and Other Sponges,
by Professor Hyatt and others&mdash;were published by Messrs. Ginn
and Heath, who have since brought out many such helps.</p>

<p>After a winter of intense activity there came a period of repose,
and no lectures were given the next season. After lying quiet for
a year the school once more came into active operation. Mrs.
Quincy A. Shaw and Mrs. Augustus Hemmenway showed their
sympathy with the efforts on behalf of education by most generously
assuming the whole expense of the lessons given that year. Immediate
measures were taken to carry out the plan which had been
arranged several years before, which consisted in giving a series
of lessons which would be a good preparation for a course in physiography.
Accordingly, Professor Cross, of the Institute of Technology,
was engaged to give eight lessons in physics, Professor Hyatt
following with eight on the physical relations of animals to the
earth; Professor Goodale gave four treating of plants in the same
way, and Mr. W. O. Crosby concluded the course with four lectures
on the relations of geological agencies to physiography. The applications
for tickets to these lectures so far exceeded the expectations
of the committee that they were forced to duplicate them,
each speaker repeating his lesson on the same day before a different
audience.</p>

</div>

<p>After this the work of The Teachers' School of Science was
taken under the protection of the Lowell Fund, Mr. Augustus
Lowell sending word that he would make an annual donation of
fifteen hundred dollars. Mr. Lowell allowed the Natural History
Society to make engagements and announce lectures one year beforehand,
and also gave the use of Huntington Hall. Eighteen
lectures were given that winter, under the title of the Lowell Free
Lectures in The Teachers' School of Science. Eight of these lectures
were on physics, by Professor Cross; five on geology, by Mr.
Crosby; five on physiology, by Dr. H. P. Bowditch, of the Harvard
Medical School, and all were very successful and well attended
by the teachers. The Teachers' School of Science had another
branch in active operation, which was courses of laboratory lessons
paid for by the teachers themselves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_030_lab.jpg" width="600" height="442" alt="Laboratory of the Boston Society of Natural History" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Laboratory of the Boston Society of Natural History used by Classes of the
Teachers' School of Science.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Through the liberality and co-operation of the Woman's Education
Association the Society of Natural History was able to announce
that a seaside laboratory, under the direction of Professor
Hyatt and capable of accommodating a limited number of students,
would be open at Annisquam, Massachusetts, from June 5th to September
15th inclusive. The purpose of this laboratory was to afford
opportunities for study and observation to the development, anatomy,
and habits of common types of marine animals under suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
direction and advice. It was believed that such a laboratory would
meet the wants of many teachers who had attended practical lessons
in The Teachers' School of Science. Twenty-two persons&mdash;ten women
and twelve men (nearly double the number expected)&mdash;availed
themselves of the privileges offered. The summer work, which was
very successful, was due to the ability and energy of Mr. B. H. Van
Vleck, who had the whole charge of the instruction and work done
in the laboratory. The seaside laboratory continued to be used
successfully in the same way during seven consecutive summers,
and the work of the laboratory materially influenced the future
science teaching in several
colleges and in many public
schools of this country. In
1886 Professor Hyatt called
the attention of the Woman's
Education Association
and the society to the fact
that the laboratory had
reached a stage when it
could claim the support of
patrons of science and learning,
and be placed on an independent
and permanent
foundation. The two associations
accordingly called a
meeting, made up largely of
the representative teachers
of biology, who decided to
make an effort to establish a
permanent biological laboratory
and raise at least fifteen
hundred dollars to carry it on for five years. The result was the
foundation of the Marine Biological Laboratory, at Woods Holl,
which now attracts to its general courses teachers and other students
from all over the land, and also maintains a department for special
research work.</p>

<p>In 1882 agents were obtained, by correspondence and through
the kindness of the Secretary of the State Board of Education, Mr.
Dickinson, in forty-four towns, who distributed tickets and filled
out blanks so that the benefits of The Teachers' School of Science
were extended beyond the limits of Boston. In this year there were
two courses, one of ten lessons, by Professor Niles, on physical geography,
and five on physiology, by Dr. H. P. Bowditch. These courses
began in November and continued throughout the whole year, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
a decrease in attendance after the Christmas and April holidays.
These lessons were followed by five on elementary chemistry, by
Prof. L. M. Norton, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
His subjects were as follows: First Principles of Chemistry; the
next, Chemistry of Air, Chemistry of Water, Chemistry of Combustion,
Chemistry of Metallic Elements. There were also five
on Practical Examination, with Simple Apparatus of the Physics and
Chemistry of Vegetable Physiology, by Professor Goodale, which
were divided as follows: (1) Vegetable Assimilation, the mode in
which plants prepare food for themselves and animals; (2) The
Kinds of Food Stored in Vegetable Organs, illustrations of the
starches, sugars, oils, and albuminoidal matters; (3) How Food is
used by Plants and Animals in a Formation of New Parts, mechanics
of growth; (4) How Food is Used in Work of all Kinds by Different
Organisms; (5) Adaptations of Organisms to Extremes of Heat
and Light, chiefly with respect to geographical distribution. This
session was concluded with a series of five lessons on Chemical
Principles illustrated by Common Minerals, by Professor Crosby.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this season there was the usual large attendance,
with teachers from thirty towns, but the number was slowly
reduced. It was evident to the curator that the decline in attendance
was not due to the subjects nor the mode in which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
treated, but from fatigue on the part of the teachers, and this state
of affairs caused him to say in his annual report that "proper and
wise forethought should long ago have given teachers a portion of
every week besides the usual Saturday holiday for the pursuit of
information needed for teaching new subjects." He believed that
the efficiency of the individual teacher would be greatly increased
by this expedient, and that the pupils would gain more than they
lost by the shortening of the school hours.</p>

<p>At the request of the Superintendent of Schools the curator gave
the following year ten lessons, which were directed mainly to the
subjects put down in the course of study under the title of Elementary
Science Lessons. In his course in Elementary Mineralogy,
Professor Crosby followed the plan indicated by Mrs. E. H. Richards
in one of the science guides&mdash;First Lessons in Minerals. The
curator, for his course on Structure and Habits of Worms, Insects,
and Vertebrates, used many specimens which had been tanned by
a process which was then in use. Over twenty-eight thousand
zo&ouml;logical specimens were given away in two years. Professor
Crosby, with a class of sixty, continued the course of the previous
year, giving lessons in the mineralogical laboratory of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and the specimens there studied
were retained by the teachers.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1888-'89 Professor Crosby, using for his auditorium
Huntington Hall, gave a course of ten lessons on the geology
of Boston and vicinity. "The object of the lessons was to acquaint
the teachers of Boston and vicinity with natural opportunities
by which they are surrounded, and specially to show them how
to use these opportunities for their own culture and the benefit of
their pupils. The subject was treated in accordance with the following
scheme: (1) A general study of the physical features of the
Boston basin and of the geological changes now in progress in this
region; (2) a systematic study of the various minerals and rocks
found in the Boston basin, together with the more characteristic
kinds of structure which they exhibit; (3) a summary of the geological
history of the district so far as that is plainly recorded in
the rocks. The course was freely illustrated by maps and diagrams,
also to a large extent by specimens, more than ten thousand
of which were distributed. Special pains were taken at every step
of the work to indicate the localities where phenomena such as were
described in the lessons might be most advantageously studied.
This comprehensive course formed suitable preparation for a second
series of lessons, the principal object of which was to apply the
principles taught by the first series to a thorough and detailed study
of the physical history of the Boston basin. Each important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
locality in the section under consideration formed the subject of a
separate lesson, in which its structural features and the more important
events of its history were presented. Special attention
was given to tracing the relations of the existing surface features
of each district to its geological structure, thus connecting the
physical geography and geology of the region. These lectures
were based on a large amount of original investigation and
results reached by Professor Crosby in his studies of the Boston
basin."</p>

<p>During the winter of 1886-'87 Prof. W. M. Davis delivered a
course on Problems in Physical Geographic Classification, treated
of in two lessons, and the Laws of the Evolution of the Principal
Topographical Types occupied the remainder of the course. Professor
Davis gave the class
the benefit of the results of
his investigations, which were
original contributions of importance
to the progress of
physical geography. "The
graphic manner of illustrating
the lessons upon the Glacial
period and the effects of
the great glacier upon the
area of the Great Lakes was
very effective. This was
shown by means of a relief
model whose surface was
composed of an ingenious arrangement
of overlying and
differently painted surfaces.
By removing these in succession
the lecturer traced the
whole history of changes following
upon the recession of
a continental glacier and its effects upon the surface waters....
These lessons were so novel and useful to teachers that he was invited
to give a course of ten lessons during the next winter upon
the physical geography of the United States. New matter,
new models, and more extended illustrations were used in this
course. The objects of the course were: To illustrate the value
of systematic classification in the study of physical geography in
order that forms of similar origin might be grouped together; to
advocate the importance of studying the evolution of geographic
forms in time, so that forms similar in origin but dissimilar in age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
(and consequently in degree of development) might be regarded
as their natural relations; to apply these principles to the physical
geography of our own land; and, finally, to promote the use of models
in geographic teaching. The different parts of the country
were considered in this order: The mountains as constituting the
framework of the continent, the plains and plateaus flanking the
mountains, the rivers carrying the waste of the land into the ocean,
the lakes temporarily interrupting the transportation of waste to
the ocean and retarding the action of the rivers, the shore line
where the land dips under the sea."</p>

<p>Persons interested in the improvement of the teaching of geography
in the public schools suggested to the trustee of the Lowell
Institute the advisability of hearing again from Professor Davis,
and the curator was requested to invite him to give a course of eight
lectures on geography in the autumn and winter of 1897-'98. The
subjects treated of in these lessons were selected from among those
presented by Professor Davis in his course on geography in the Harvard
Summer School, as they afforded material most directly applicable
to the work of grammar-school teachers. At the end of
each meeting opportunity was given for individual conference on
questions suggested by the lectures. This course excited more interest
among teachers than any which had been given since the beginning
of the school, and it was consequently a serious disappointment
to many teachers when it became known that Mr. Lowell did
not feel able to re-engage Professor Davis and continue this kind
of instruction.</p>

<p>The same winter that Professor Davis gave his first course on
physical geography Prof. F. W. Putnam, of Harvard University,
Curator of Peabody Museum of American Arch&aelig;ology and Anthropology
at Cambridge, and now President of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, gave lessons on American arch&aelig;ology.
The topics selected covered the whole range of the remains
of prehistoric man and his life on this continent so far as these
subjects could be presented in ten lessons. The original methods
of research elaborated by Professor Putnam, which have placed his
name among the first in his department of arch&aelig;ological work, rendered
this course remarkably interesting and instructive. Specimens
were studied and given away in sufficient numbers to illustrate
the modes of making stone implements and some of the different
kinds of pottery. Professor Putnam invited the teachers to visit the
Peabody Museum, and there gave them an opportunity to inspect the
larger objects which it had not been possible to bring into the city.
The audience became so interested in the famous serpent mound in
Ohio, which was then threatened with destruction, that a subscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
was started which finally made it possible to purchase and
preserve this ancient monument.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">F. W. Putnam.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The winter succeeding the lessons on arch&aelig;ology, Mr. B. H. Van
Vleck, who had spent a considerable portion of the previous summer
in preparing specimens for this work, gave fifteen lessons on zo&ouml;logy.
The study of the general morphology of animals was made
under advantages such as had never before been offered in this
school, and enabled teachers to see and study structures not usually
within their reach. The
work was mainly directed to
the observation and study of
a limited number of types,
but general points in physiology
and anatomy were also
taken up in a comparative
way. The microscope was
also used in this work. This
special course was continued
during the next two terms.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Walter Fewkes
gave a series of ten lessons,
during the winter of 1890-'91,
on Common Marine Animals
from Massachusetts
Bay. Special attention was
given to the mode of life,
differences in external forms,
local distribution, habitats,
methods and proper times to
collect the eggs, young, and adults. The anatomy, embryology,
and morphology of the species considered were dealt with incidentally.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/illo_036_fewkes.jpg" width="460" height="600" alt="J. Walter Fewkes." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">J. Walter Fewkes.</span></span>
</div>

<p>"The relative abundance of species and individuals, local causes
which influenced distribution, the rocky or sandy nature of the
shores and their characteristic faun&aelig;, and the influence of depth
of water tides and temperature, were also considered."</p>

<p>The relations and boundaries of the marine fauna of New England
were treated of under the following heads: Comparison of the
Fauna of Massachusetts Bay with that of Narragansett Bay and
the Bay of Fundy, and Causes of the Differences Observed; Pelagic
Animals; Littoral and Shallow-Water Genera; Introduced and Indigenous
Marine Animals; and Marine Animals which inhabit both
Brackish and Fresh Water.</p>

<p>It having been found that for several years the audiences at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
the general courses had been decreasing, it became evident that the
giving of general information had accomplished a mission, but that
there was a demand for more specialized courses of study and that
a change of policy was warranted. It was therefore determined
to abandon the general courses and continue the special prolonged
laboratory courses.</p>

<p>Since 1891 all lessons have been given either in the form of
laboratory lessons or field work, and the school was organized and
conducted upon a new and more effective basis. The teachers have
been required to keep notebooks and attend examinations in order
to be candidates for the certificates which have been, and will continue
to be, granted to those who have completed a series of lessons.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1890 was begun a course of lessons on paleontology
which had been planned for some time but had not been previously
undertaken because the teachers lacked the knowledge of the elements
of zo&ouml;logy and geology which was a necessary preparation
for those taking up the study of the history of animals as found in
the earth's crust. The members of this class, which now began to
make systematic observations upon fossils, were found to be sufficiently
prepared to study certain groups which illustrated the laws
of evolution. The class was limited in number and was under the instruction
of Professor Hyatt, who for five years conducted the most
advanced course of lessons ever given in The Teachers' School of
Science, and such as have not elsewhere been offered to teachers nor
to many classes of college students.</p>

<p>The lessons began with general instruction in the use of the
microscope, the structure of cells and their union and differentiation
into tissues, and then a study of simplest organisms&mdash;<i>Protozoa</i>.
The work was continued through <i>Porifera</i>, <i>Hydrozoa</i>, and <i>Actinozoa</i>,
and the types of fossils compared with their living representatives.
The periods of occurrence of fossilized remains in the rocks
were noted, and the characteristics of the different periods mentioned,
but details of stratigraphic character were subordinated to
the tracing out of the relations of the animals and the laws which
governed the evolution of their forms. Special attention was given
to those classes whose history is most complete and which furnish
the best specimens for examination.</p>

<p><i>Echinodermata</i>, represented by a large number of both living
and fossil forms, was made the subject of study the second winter.
The common starfish was examined in detail, and with it were compared
other members of its class&mdash;<i>Asteroidea</i>, living and fossil
forms in <i>Ophiuridea</i> and <i>Echinoidea</i>, the modern <i>Holothuroidea</i>, the
ancient <i>Blastoids</i> and <i>Cystoids</i>, and both extinct and modern <i>Crinoids</i>,
the last of which were illustrated by alcohol specimens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
<i>Comatula</i>. Professor Hyatt was assisted in giving these lessons
by Miss J. M. Arms, who, in conjunction with him, had previously
written the largest of the Science Guides&mdash;entitled Insecta&mdash;and
by Dr. Robert T. Jackson, who has done much work on this group of
fossils. One member of the class a few years ago, after receiving
these lessons, looked over and prepared a large number of fossils,
principally <i>Crinoids</i>, belonging to the Natural History Society, and
discovered a form of paleozoic <i>Echinoderm</i>, which proved to be an
interesting new species and was described by Dr. Jackson as <i>Lepidesthes
Wortheni</i>.</p>

<p>The third year of this series consisted of lessons on <i>Brachiopoda</i>
exclusively. Professor Hyatt was at that time in correspondence
with Dr. C. E. Beecher, of Yale, the distinguished paleontologist,
who has made remarkable
discoveries and was then investigating
<i>Brachiopoda</i>, and
communications from him
regarding this group were
from time to time read to the
class. "The sudden expansion
or the quick evolution
in the earlier periods of the
earth's history and the slower
evolution of the same
types in their progressive history,
after a period of sudden
expansion had been
passed through," were shown
in several series.</p>

<p>The ancestral form of
this group, the phylembryo,
has been found in <i>Paterina</i>,
whose adult represents the
youngest stage, the beak of
the shell, of other <i>Brachiopods</i>. There was, therefore, unusual
opportunity to here illustrate theories of evolution, particularly
the theory of constitutional tendency involving a conception of the
youth, maturity, and senescence of species. In order to make the
instruction clearer, terms used for the different stages of development
by Professor Hyatt in his writings on bioplastology were explained
to and used by the class.</p>

<p>The many specimens used in this study were carefully figured
in the notebooks, and the teachers became so familiar with them
that they were able to pass at the end of the term a severe examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
The final test of the season's work consisted of three parts:
The passing in of lecture notebooks, the naming and classifying of a
dozen fossils selected by the professor, and the answering of a set
of difficult questions.</p>

<p>On account of the amount of time required for this course, and
because the lessons were such as were not directly applicable to
work in the public schools, the attendance decreased. The number
who continued, however, were those who felt that a broad scientific
education is necessary to the best teaching of even elementary
science.</p>

<p>The fourth year was devoted to <i>Mollusca</i>, <i>Cephalopoda</i> in particular,
and the class was fortunate in having for its teacher one
whose investigations in this latter group have given him world-wide
fame.</p>

<p>The evolution of the group from its straight radical form, now
named and called <i>Diphragnoceros</i>, was traced through the bent,
curved, and coiled forms of the <i>Nautiloids</i>, <i>Ammonoids</i>, and <i>Belamites</i>.
The phylogeny of the <i>Ammonoids</i> presented a complete
cycle, late forms entirely uncoiling and presenting the straight
characters of their ancestors.</p>

<p>The study of <i>Cephalopods</i> amply illustrated the neo-Lamarckian
theory of evolution, including the inheritance of acquired characters
which is now believed by most paleontologists.</p>

<p>The fifth and last year of this course included the study of <i>Arthropoda</i>
and <i>Vertebrata</i>. The insects presented many illustrations
for the theory of natural selection, which the neo-Lamarckians
consider an aid, but a subordinate factor, in the origin of
species.</p>

<p>About this time Poulton gave a series of twelve lectures on
animal coloration at the Lowell Institute, drawing his
illustrations mainly from insects. Many of the students of The Teachers'
School of Science in zo&ouml;logy and paleontology attended these
lectures.</p>

<p>After working on fishes, batrachians, reptiles, birds, and mammals,
in which the structural development of some animals&mdash;man,

structure as compared with the anthropoid apes and the few remains
of prehistoric man, and finally with a discussion of the works of
paleolithic man.</p>

<h2>PROPER OBJECTS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By EDWARD ORTON</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY IN OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY;
PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.</span></p>


<p>The objects of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science are clearly expressed in the opening paragraph of
its constitution, which was adopted at its first meeting, held September
20, 1848, in Philadelphia. From that day to this the paragraph
referred to has not been modified except by the replacement
of three words, viz., "the United States" by a single and more
comprehensive word&mdash;"America."</p>

<p>As here defined, the objects of the association are "to promote
intercourse between those who are cultivating science in different
parts of America, to give a stronger and more general impulse and a
more systematic direction to scientific research in our country, and
to procure for the labors of scientific men increased facilities and a
wider usefulness."</p>

<p>Three distinct elements are included in this general statement,
viz.: (1) The cultivation of personal intercourse or acquaintance
among the workers in science in this country; (2) the encouragement,
extension, and proper direction of scientific research; (3)
the gaining of popular recognition and good will for the results of
scientific work. These objects may be conveniently summarized as
(1) <i>social</i>, (2) <i>scientific</i>, (3) <i>practical</i>.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the original paragraph to indicate whether
the elements of this threefold division were counted of equal value,
or whether they were arranged in either an ascending or descending
scale of importance, but from the fact that in the development and
expansion of the association during the last fifty years nothing has
been added to and nothing subtracted from this general statement,
while in many other divisions of the constitution large and sometimes
radical changes have been adopted, it seems safe to conclude
that the present members of the association see its work and office
in very much the same light as its founders did.</p>

<p>But, while sailing under the old colors and apparently by the
old charts, it is quite possible that the association is, insensibly to
itself, undergoing modification more or less important. Such an
experience is unavoidable in all human institutions, at least in those
that retain their vitality in state, society, or church.</p>

<p>The fifty years that cover the life of the association are unquestionably
the most important, so far as the growth of science is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
concerned, in the history of the race. Within this period every science
has been recast and rewritten, and divisions and subdivisions of the
old units have gone forward and are still in progress. Of every
one of these sciences the boundaries have been so enormously extended
that even the <i>dream</i> of universal knowledge on the part of
any man has gone by, never to return. Leibnitz, it has been said,
was the last of the intellectual giants of old who mastered all that
was knowable in his day. Alexander von Humboldt could almost
claim the same for the knowledge of Nature that was attainable in
the first quarter of our century. But since the application of the
compound microscope to the study of Nature and the subdivisions
of the sciences that have resulted therefrom, and especially since
the extension of the method of science to all the branches of anthropology,
as language, history, institutions, the task of mastering
all that is known is seen to be altogether too great for finite powers
and span-long lives.</p>

<p>It might well be, therefore, in view of the amazing changes that
have taken place in the entire field covered by the association, that
it should have outgrown the aims and ambitions of its early days.
The fact that it continues to use the identical statement of its objects
with which it began its work, while it does not definitely settle
the question, affords at least presumptive evidence that no such
change has taken place.</p>

<p>How, then, do the objects originally recognized by the association
as its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> correspond to the needs of our own time?</p>

<p>1. Is the <i>social</i> feature of the association, to which the first
place was assigned by the founders, whether by design or not,
worthy of preservation by us? In other words, is it as important
"to promote intercourse between those who are cultivating science
in America" at the close of the nineteenth century as it was at the
middle of the century&mdash;the need that was responded to by the formation
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science?
While revolutionary changes have taken place in the country
at large during this period in modes of travel, facilities for acquiring
education, and the diffusion of intelligence, it would be hard to
show why the need in this field should be in any respect less urgent.
There is a far larger number of people who are cultivating science,
and there are many more branches of science to be cultivated.</p>

<p>What particular service is to be expected from such intercourse
as the association seeks to provide? The gathering of the workers
in the diverse fields of science into a single organization has a tendency
to <i>unify</i> them. They find that a common spirit animates
them, that they all make use of essentially the same method of research
or inquiry, and that the results which they reach all have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
common note of certainty, being herewith differentiated from other
and older views on the same subjects, as knowledge differs from
opinion. They are thus led to see more clearly than they could
otherwise see the unity of the universe, that knowledge is one, and
that each science is but a facet cut on the crystal sphere of natural
truth, touching other facets at many points, and by no means independent,
but supported by the integrity of the sphere.</p>

<p>Such a gathering tends to an increase of mutual respect and
confidence on the part of all engaged in scientific work. It tends
to discourage the narrow conceit of the specialist, who, if left entirely
to his own tastes, comes to think that his own facet is the
only one that deserves to be regarded, and practically to ignore its
relation to the sphere of which it constitutes an essential though
a minor part.</p>

<p>Such an association tends toward making specialists intelligible
to each other. In other words, it puts a premium on the art of
popularizing science, for when the specialist makes himself intelligible
to his brethren in their widely separated fields he makes himself
intelligible to all educated men, whether especially trained in
science or not.</p>

<p>The specialist is under a strong temptation to limit himself to
a language of his own, which is an unknown tongue even to the
rest of the scientific world. Technical terms, carried out to minute
subdivisions, are indispensable in every branch of modern science,
but the student of any science is in an evil state who can not present
his results to the world without appealing to the technical
jargon of the branch which he cultivates.</p>

<p>There even seems a reluctance on the part of some to use plain
language in stating scientific conclusions, as if the cheapening of
science were feared by its being made intelligible. Such a fear is
certainly unworthy. The masters have never felt it. In lucidity
and directness of speech and in general intelligibility Tyndall, Huxley,
and Darwin were not surpassed by any men of their generation.
To whom are we as much indebted for the great advance of
science in their day as to these very men?</p>

<p>If the scientist neglects this popularizing of science, the sciolist
is sure to take it up, and his work in this field always makes the
judicious grieve. Is there not possible danger that this phase of
scientific work and the function of the association corresponding
thereto are losing consideration to some extent?</p>

<p>But instead of its being true that the scientific work of the
country has outgrown the need of the association, is it not rather
true that we are in far more urgent need of its unifying agency
than even the founders were fifty years ago? We have all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
divisions of science that were then recognized, and half as many
more. Physics and chemistry could then be classed in one section
without offense, and zo&ouml;logy and botany were assigned without
protest to a single heading. Now, not only does every science demand
recognition by and of itself, but all are represented by separate
societies as well&mdash;as the Mathematical Society, the Chemical
Society, the Geological Society, etc. These societies hold meetings,
publish bulletins, reports, and sometimes monthly journals,
and, in short, aim to cover the entire field for the branches which
they represent. They are generally affiliated with the association,
and it is becoming usual for them to hold joint summer meetings
of society and section. Their annual meetings are held in the
winter, and, as their membership is more select than that of the
association, standing as it does in all cases for published or recognized
work already in evidence, these winter meetings are coming
to be preferred for the presentation of technical papers. Those
who read them feel sure of "fit audience, though few."</p>

<p>These societies are all vigorous and successful. They obviously
meet a "felt want" on the part of American science, but just what
their effect will be upon the association remains to be determined.
Certainly, with these centrifugal tendencies in growing activity,
this is not the time for the attraction of our one centripetal force to
be relaxed. More than ever do we need such a unifying agency as
the association was designed to supply.</p>

<p>Some <i>modus vivendi</i> between section and society will doubtless
be found. Perhaps the more abstract and technical papers will be
reserved for the winter meetings, while those dealing with the
larger phases, and especially those pertaining to the philosophy of
the subjects discussed, will find their places in the joint meetings
of the summer.</p>

<p>It would be well if the association meetings of whatever character
could be made memorable by the announcement of important
discoveries made during the preceding year. The custom of holding
back such announcements is said to obtain in the transatlantic
national associations, and notably in the British Association, which
is the mother of all the rest. Those who were present at the Boston
meeting of the American Association will remember the enthusiasm
created there by the announcement of the discovery of a new
element&mdash;etherion. If later discussions have thrown doubt upon
the discovery of a new element, the alternative explanation suggested
of the facts proves scarcely less interesting or important than
the original claim.</p>

<p>Whether our eager American workers would be willing to hazard
their claims to priority by holding back the announcements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
their discoveries for months after they have been made is a question,
but the foreign practice in this regard has certainly much to
commend it.</p>

<p>It would be a calamity of real magnitude to American science
if the sectional meetings of the association were abandoned to men
who have not done enough approved work to entitle them to places
in the several societies already named. The old title&mdash;The American
Association for the Advancement of Science&mdash;might still be
retained, it is true, but what a humiliating misnomer it would be
if none of the men who <i>have</i> advanced science in the past by their
labors and none of those who are prepared to advance it in the
future by their training were now included! It would be the omission
of the part of Hamlet from the play.</p>

<p>The foremost men in all the societies, our leaders in the branches
represented there, owe it to themselves, owe it much more to the
great name of American science, to maintain and magnify their
connection with, their service to, the American Association.</p>

<p>At the second meeting of the association it was the illustrious
Joseph Henry who called the attention of his brethren to the fact
that the organization was, by its very name, consecrated to the
<i>advancement</i> of science&mdash;to the discovery of new truth. He reminded
them that the association was not designed to furnish
opportunity for the restatement of what was already known. Its
purpose was rather to add to the existing body of knowledge in the
world. Let not the hopes of the founders be brought to naught
by allowing the organization from which they expected so much to
be thus eviscerated!</p>

<p>We see, then, that the <i>social feature</i>, with what it legitimately
includes, deserves to hold as prominent a place among the objects
of the association at the end of the century as was given to it by
its founders when first established.</p>

<p>Two other objects which were deemed worthy of being incorporated
into the organic law of the association remain to be considered.
To the treatment of each a few words will be devoted.
Neither of them commands as high regard from us as they seem to
have had at the beginning.</p>

<p>2. The second object of the association as declared by the founders
was "to give a stronger and more general impulse and a more
systematic direction to scientific research in our country."</p>

<p>It is not easy for those who were born after the middle point of
the century to think themselves back into the conditions under
which the words above quoted were written. At that time there
were but two or three schools of science in the United States, and
not one west of the seaboard. The degrees of bachelor, master, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
doctor of science were unknown. There was but one journal of
science published in the country, and foreign scientific journals and
reviews, comparatively weak and few at the best, seldom found their
way to the New World. The men who cultivated science were
widely separated, and for the most part rarely met their peers. As
a natural consequence, there must have been more or less misdirected
effort. Many a worker must have attacked problems
already solved, or have attacked them by inadequate or obsolete
methods.</p>

<p>How great the changes that fifty years have wrought in this
country, in the world indeed, in all these respects! Now there is
not a State in the Union that has not at least one fairly equipped
school of science, and in some of the older States such schools can
be counted by the dozen or the score. These schools are manned
by teachers trained at the foremost centers of science in this country
and Europe, familiar with all the great problems and with all
the most improved methods of research. Moreover, on the library
table of every one of these schools are the latest periodicals and
special reports of the two continents in which science is cultivated.
The untrained and isolated investigator can no longer justify his
existence. There is no occasion for the survival of such qualities
as these terms imply.</p>

<p>This wonderful transformation in educational scope and methods
effects to a great degree just what the founders hoped to accomplish
through the agency of the association. The ground has thus
been cut from under the second of the objects of the association
as avowed in its constitution. In other words, while the result
aimed at deserved the prominence given to it fifty years ago, it no
longer depends on the association for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>3. The third of the objects which the association was organized
to accomplish was "to procure for the labors of scientific men increased
facilities and a wider usefulness." This clause evidently
refers to the endowment of science by founding and equipping institutions,
professorships, laboratories, museums, and the like, and to
a more cordial and general appreciation of the results of scientific
work.</p>

<p>In this direction, also, such immense progress has been made in
the country at large that the need of special effort in this line no
longer exists. Munificent gifts to science from private fortunes
are now the order of the day. It is a poor year for science in
America when such contributions do not exceed a million dollars.
This work was begun in the large way under the elder Agassiz, and
the Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy at Cambridge is its first important
monument. It has gone forward in the addition of scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
departments worthy of the name to the older institutions of
learning, and in the establishment of new institutions wholly devoted
to science.</p>

<p>Such beneficent use of private wealth, the unparalleled increase
of which during the last fifty years has become a matter of grave
concern to the whole body politic, does more than anything else can
do to reconcile the public to the conditions which make such accumulations
possible. Still more significant is the policy which the
General Government entered upon, forty years ago, of establishing,
in conjunction with the several States, schools of general and applied
science. The State colleges and universities thus founded
have already become potent factors in American education, and
science lies at the heart of them all. It would be hard to overrate
their influence on the development of science for time to come.</p>

<p>When the American Association was established, fifty years ago,
a new day was breaking on the world. The men who were cultivating
science then saw something of the conquests over Nature
that the new method&mdash;the method of science&mdash;rendered possible.
They were wise in demanding that all who use this method should
recognize the common bond. The association was the outcome of
that demand.</p>

<p>At the end of the century we who have shared in the mighty
advance and who have been taught by our experience to discard
limitations in the possibilities of the future, feel the same and an
even more urgent need of some unifying and interpreting agency
for the ever-widening fields to which the method of science is now
applied.</p>

<h2>RACE QUESTIONS IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By FERDINAND BLUMENTRITTE.</span></p>


<p>When I published my article on the History of Separatism in
the Spanish colonies, in the <i>Deutsche Rundschau</i> for July,
1898, I said that the colored peoples of a colony would always be
inclined to struggle for the independence of their native country,
because the rule of the mother country of the colony makes their
access to the highest positions in the state impossible. I declared,
further, that in the Philippine Islands the contempt manifested
toward the colored tribes by the Spanish press had contributed
very much toward making the gulf between rulers and ruled progressively
deeper and harder to bridge. The natural conceit and
sensitiveness of the colored races in America could never weigh as
heavy in the scale as those of the colored Filipinos do, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
in America the creoles and their numerously represented crosses
were the real upholders of separatist ideas, so that when the idea
ripened into an act they held the leading of the movement in their
hands. Indians and negroes have there never been more than the
<i>plebs contribuens</i>, or the tributary class, and "food for cannon."
Only in single exceptional cases have leading spirits ever risen from
out of these lower castes; and where the separatist movement has
been confined to these colored primitive races, as in Haiti, it has
led not only to cutting loose from the mother country, but also to
a more or less complete renunciation of European civilization. In
saying this I cast no condemnation upon the negroes, for, whenever
in our civilized states the proletariat and the populace have struck
down or cast out all the cultivated and half-cultivated classes, the
same sort of "nigger management," with only differences corresponding
with the environments, has gained place among us as in
the great islands of the Antilles.</p>

<p>Very different are the conditions in the Philippine Islands; and,
in view of the importance which the "skin question" plays in the
conflict raged by the Americans, I think it proper to deal further
with this fundamental question of Philippine politics, especially
since the journals and the politicians, at least those of America, have
given very little attention to the matter.</p>

<p>The small number of creoles, of whom, besides, the principal
part live in the city of Manila, which the Americans have in their
power, would not alone explain why the war of independence and
the formation of the Philippine republic must be spoken of as pre-eminently
the work of Christian, civilized Malays and mestizos.
For there are in America countries, like Paraguay, where the number
of whites is even smaller than in the Philippine Islands, and yet
the separatist movement and the foundation of the state were the
exclusive work of the creoles.</p>

<p>Why has it been thus? Because the Indians and the negroes
do not possess that inclination toward civilization and that capacity
for assimilation that are evident in the colored populations of the
Philippine Islands. It is supposed that the Philippine Malays have
Japanese blood in their veins; but, all the same, whether the supposition
is founded or unfounded, it is certain that not only do they
resemble the Japanese more or less in features, but that also many
mental traits are common to them with these wide-awake Orientals,
and they even excel them in a moral respect. The school statistics
show them superior to their Spanish lords. The Filipinos have no
larger percentage of illiterates than Spain of those who can not read
and write. And, as a bishop exclaimed with astonishment, there
are in those islands villages where it would be hard to find a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
unable to read. The pressure of the colored people to the higher
studies and the special schools far exceeds the percentage which one
would anticipate from their proportion to the whole population.
And if we add to these those who seek their education in Spain and
other foreign countries we shall find Malays and mestizos in the first
line, and the creoles in the last. It should be remarked on this point
that many more natives would have gone to Europe for education if
the Spaniards, and especially the monks, had not perceived conspirators
in all Filipinos who studied away from home. The fear
of persecution deterred many fathers from sending their sons over
the sea.</p>

<p>More than ten years ago a prominent monkish writer showed
how the professions of medicine and the law were crowded with
Malays and mestizos. But besides these two professions and that
of the secular clergy the colored Filipinos turned also to engineering
and art. With respect to art, I am not thinking of the skillful
goldsmiths and silversmiths of Manila, although these artificers are
among the best, but I refer to artists of divine gifts, among whom
the mestizo F. Resureccion Hidalgo, resident in Paris, and Don
Juan Luna, of the tribe of Ilokans of northwestern Luzon, brother of
the Philippine minister Antonio Luna, are most conspicuous. Luna
is not unknown to us Germans, for the Leipsic <i>Illustrirte Zeitung</i>
some time ago published a wood engraving of his great prize-crowned
picture Spoliarum. The best testimony to his eminence is the fact
that the Spanish Senate honored this artist, who was then living in
Paris, with the commission to paint for its chamber a pendant to
Padilla's famous picture Boabdil Surrendering the Keys of Granada
to the Catholic Queen, and he painted The Battle of Lepanto. And
among the Filipino poets the name of the great Tagal, Dr. Rizal, has
become known to the whole world through his skill in tragedy.</p>

<p>There is no need of mentioning any other names, for those we
have given are enough to show that these Malays and mestizos are
susceptible of cultivation, and, as Bismarck used to say, "carry a
rocket-charge in their bodies."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>As the Spaniards who came to the archipelago were for the most
part only monks or officers, trade, so far as it was not in the hands
of foreigners, was dependent on the participation of the colored
population, particularly of the mestizos. And what of large land
ownership the monkish orders had not absorbed likewise belonged
for the most part to the colored races. None but foreigners and
colored took part in all the great enterprises of the country. The
Spaniards only ruled.</p>

<p>This position of the colored population in the country was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
more perilous to the Spaniards, because the Spanish press, particularly
the monkish journals, systematically treated them with scorn,
called them anthropoids, and denied their capacity to attain European
civilization. The educated Filipinos foamed with rage when
spoken to about these attacks upon their race. "Besides," they
said, "it makes the color of our skin a stigma with the Spanish lords,
and with all Europe too; why thus insult us and in so cowardly a
way, when the censorship at Manila makes it impossible for us to
defend ourselves?"</p>

<p>But all these noisy revilings of their race could only outwardly,
not inwardly, disturb the self-esteem of the Malays, because their
leading spirits had by critical psychological studies of the white
race confirmed the opinion of the simple Tagal peasants that the
whites are made out of the same earth as the colored, and that the
latter could, under equal conditions, have done as well as they.
Only the whites have adopted that lordly code of morals which, like
the flag with contraband goods, covers the grossest breaches of
right and other outrages, which a white gentleman would not venture,
indeed, to commit upon his peers, but which, in the treatment
of colored men, belong, so to speak, to good tone, to "European
smartness."</p>

<p>The educated brown man generally feels in his intercourse with
the European that uneasiness, that poorly concealed embarrassment,
which the parvenue with us feels in the presence of one of the
blue-blooded aristocracy. He feels every instant that the white
man's critical eye is upon him, and knows that the criticism will be
pitiless and harsh to injustice. He knows, further, that this criticism
in every case does not apply only to him, the individual, but
that conclusions are drawn at once from his errors, even though
they may be only presumed, that are applied to his whole race or
caste&mdash;conclusions which are never flattering, but always culminate,
in agreement with the scorn of the superior, in a severe condemnation.</p>

<p>This consciousness of running the gantlet before the eyes of
Europeans often causes the brown man to commit mistakes in European
society, which refuses to pass him among people whose favor
he would be sure to enjoy.</p>

<p>The opinion which Europeans living in the tropics form of the
brown men is generally unfavorable and unjust to them. We Europeans,
or rather our nations and states, already judge one another
harshly and in a more than partisan manner, because we see
first only the weaknesses, often even only the fancied weaknesses,
of our neighbors. How, then, could we expect anything better
when a European has to pass an opinion on a brown man? We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
should not forget that only those Europeans go to the tropics who
display special energy and force of will&mdash;a kind of chosen lot among
our race&mdash;while the natives there include all the levels of the people.
If we add to this that all the Europeans believe in their own
superiority and in the inferiority of the brown men, it will seem quite
natural that when the Europeans begin to make comparisons between
themselves and the natives the comparisons will always be
flattering to those who make them.</p>

<p>In the Philippine Islands, on the other hand, the reaction of the
natives against this extreme self-conceit of the whites has been making
itself felt for more than twenty years. This has come to pass
since the philosophical heads among them have carefully studied
the whites in the various countries of Europe, and have in consequence
lost faith in the divine likeness of the Caucasians.</p>

<p>Single examples of the studies of these men have been published,
such as that of the war minister of the Philippine republic, Don
Antonio Luna, a pure-blooded Malay like his brother the painter.
Luna studied in Spain and in Paris (under Pasteur), and lived a
little while in England, so that he had opportunities to become acquainted
with three civilized nations at their home. His literary
works are represented to us in the garb of novels and <i>feuilletons</i>, the
sarcasm of which, while it certainly escapes the uninitiated European,
will be all the more effective and precious upon those who are
acquainted with the purpose of the brilliant author, which is to
satirize the depreciatory accounts by European travelers of the land
and people of the Philippine Islands. This he does by telling of his
rummaging through the critics' home and finding all the weaknesses
and faults which are accredited to the brown men as signs of their
incapacity no less prevalent in Europe than in the Philippine archipelago;
and arguing that therefore the whites and the browns differ
only in the color of their skin, in build, and in language, but not
in mind.</p>

<p>If space allowed I should be glad to follow my inclination to
repeat some of Luna's descriptions, which are given in a style that
reminds one of Maupassant's. I shall only say that Luna has drawn
within the circle of his observations the movements of all classes
in the aristocratic saloon and in the workman's beerhouse, and
remarks that everything that has been charged against the brown
man appears likewise in the European. The first sketch is excellent.
European travelers speak in their works of the "stupid staring"
at their white-skinned, thoughtful faces by the "brown savages."
Luna, whose pen-name is Taga-ilog,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> parodies these stories
by simply relating that on his arrival in Europe and during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
earlier residence there the people on the streets stared at him, and
some of the boys threw stones or stuck out their tongues at him.
He did not, however, care for that, while he expected that the better
circles would convince him of the superiority and the innate tact
of the lordly race by their more refined behavior. But it did not
turn out so. He saw the ladies in the saloons tittering behind their
fans and making merry over "the queer man." And then at the
table! How plain was the expression of astonishment among the
gentlemen of the saloons that the brown man behaved in his eating
just as the whites did! They had apparently anticipated that the
"black" would act as if he were tearing live pigeons to pieces and
swallowing them. The indolence of the Europeans is shown up
no less amusingly. Luna finds it apparent in all conditions, prevailing
in the highest and the lowest social strata. He asks what
would become of the industry and activity of the European peoples
if they were suddenly given the climate and the fruitfulness of his
native land. These two examples are all we can give. Likewise
interesting are the studies of my Tagalog friends Don Marcelo H.
del Pilar and Don Mariano Ponce. The former, an advocate from
the province of Bulakan, in the island of Luzon, and a descendant
of King Lakandola, of Manila, was the leader of the Reformist
party and the chief editor of the journal <i>La Solidaridad</i>, published
in Madrid, which he directed with a remarkable skill that was recognized
by his opponents. He died in Barcelona in the summer
of 1896. His compeer, Ponce, is now living in Japan and is no less
distinguished than Pilar for his keen wit and his zeal in research.</p>

<p>These two Malay jurists carefully examined the criminal records
of Europe. Why? Because, whenever an extraordinary or especially
heinous crime was committed in the Philippine Islands, the
Spaniards were accustomed to use it to confirm their conclusions
as to the innate inferiority of the Malay race. "That could occur
only among a people of inferior intelligence," was their standing
phrase. Del Pilar and Ponce gathered the accounts of trials from
the European journals, and were able to reply to the Spaniards
quietly: "No, that is not so. All these crimes occur among you
Europeans, and relatively more frequently than with us. Your
conclusion is therefore false, or else you too have a defective intelligence
such as you ascribe to us." Del Pilar, from his studies of
the colonial enterprises of all peoples, came to the conclusion that
"the Europeans founded most of their colonies at a time when the
holding in vassalage of men of their own race by whites and the
slavery of negroes and Indians were not regarded as offenses. If,
now, we look at colonies in which, as in the Philippine Islands, agricultural
populations are living with a civilization of their own, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
development of the native races will depend on their religion. In
a colony where Islam or a dogmatized heathen religion prevails no
assimilation between Europeans and natives can take place. It is
otherwise in countries like the Philippines, where the natives accepted
Christianity at a time when religion had more importance
among Europeans than now; a common basis was formed for the co-operation
of both parts, the whites and the colored. But the circumstance
that rulers and ruled had the same religion and the same
official language may have led directly to another evil&mdash;that the
colors became marks of condition, the whites being the Spartans, the
mestizos the perioikoi, and the colored men the helots or servile
people. So long as no pressure toward higher ambitions occurred
from among those of the perioikoi and the helot grades, and so
long as the whites were able to keep their prestige freely recognized
by their dependents, the view of the whites, that the colored were
both socially and intellectually a lower caste, seemed to be justified.
The case has been different in the present century, especially
in the second half of it. People of our (Philippine) race attended
the high schools, appropriated to themselves the civilization and the
knowledge of the whites, and still the brand of inferiority stuck to
them. And this happened, too, when the quality of the whites
had deteriorated. They were no longer exclusively <i>se&ntilde;ors</i>, but
there came bankrupted Spaniards or those of the lowest classes into
the country, among them persons who could not read and write,
who should be rated as beneath our school-trained people. And
yet these illiterates claimed, by virtue of their color, to be respected
as lords of the land, an absurdity which left the idea of 'European
prestige' without justification, for how could beggars, spongers,
bummers, rowdies, and illiterates impress anybody? The decent
Spaniards committed the mistake of avowing their solidarity with
the sorry fellows of their caste, instead of rejecting them and holding
aloof from them and sending them back to Spain. So the Spaniards
have brought it to pass, through a mistaken policy, that the
Filipinos on their side, too, throw the good elements of the Spanish
population into the same pot with the foul. Another reason why a
Spanish prestige can not be thought of among us is that, with the
exception of the tobacco companies, all the great enterprises in our
country are carried on by foreigners and Filipinos. We owe all
that is called progress not to the Spaniards, but to our own force
or to foreigners."</p>

<p>When the painter Juan Luna attracted so much attention with
his picture Spoliarum it was not known that the artist was a Malay,
and the work was therefore regarded and criticised from a purely
artistic point of view. But as soon as the race of the painter became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
known, European prejudice made itself manifest. It was said that
the choice of a tragic subject could unquestionably be traced back
to the descent of the artist from "savages." But when did artists
of the white race ever shrink from such subjects? Luna has had
cause enough to complain of European injustice. The natives are
charged with not being independent in art. "They can only imitate,"
it is said. But how many European nations one would have
to strike out of the list of the civilized if that title is to belong only
to those which have an art of their own! It should not be forgotten
that the Spaniards have, during their three hundred years'
rule, impressed a Spanish mark on the native artistic tendencies.
The ethnographer who is acquainted with the woven and carved designs
of the heathen tribes which have remained free from the Spaniards
and from Christian civilization will certainly not be able to
deny that the Malays of the Philippine Islands have a great talent
for ornamental art. But if the reproach is cast against the Filipinos
that they have tried to Europeanize themselves in plastic art as well
as in music, they have not done differently from the Europeans&mdash;that
is, they denationalize themselves and come into the great international
circle of civilization, a thing that can hardly be charged as
a sin against them. It is very remarkable, they say, that Europeans
condemn in the Filipinos, as a mark of inferiority that which
they regard in themselves as a sign of progress.</p>

<p>Rizal also has spoken of the injustice of the judgments which
Europeans pass upon Philippine conditions. I have published his
views on this subject in the tenth volume of the <i>Internationalen
Archivs f&uuml;r Ethnographie</i>, and will therefore on the present occasion
only give a sketch of them, with a few additional observations
to complement them. Dr. Rizal says that most Europeans judge
the natives from their servants, which would be as false as if anybody
should form his conception of the German people from the
complaints which German housewives are always ready to make
concerning their domestics. At one time while he was visiting me
we strolled out of town. He gathered some wild flowers and asked
me their names. I had to confess respecting many of them that
I knew neither their common nor their botanical names. He
laughed and said: "Well, you are a cit; let us ask a countryman."
We met a peasant, but he could not give us any information about
any of the flowers. "Why," Rizal said, "is this the first time you
ever saw the flowers?" The peasant replied that he knew the
flowers very well, but did not know what they were called. When
the countryman had gone, Rizal said to me: "How fortunate you
Europeans are as compared with us poor Tagals! If such an experience
as I have just gone through should happen to a European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
among us he would write in his notebook that 'the stupidity of
these people shows itself in the fact that they do not know or have
no names for many of the flowers which they see every day and
tread upon with their clumsy feet. What can not be eaten or put
to some immediate use has very little value or interest to these fellows,
and such dull-witted folk as these want reform and autonomy!'
And he would be only a modest traveler. Another one would write
a whole chapter over the incident, as illustrating the inferiority of
all our people."</p>

<p>I might continue at greater length on this theme, but I believe
that the reader will sufficiently apprehend from what I have said
that the European and American whites have not made a good impression
on the colored Filipinos, and that the Philippine creoles feel
as one with their colored brethren; that there is no spirit of caste
in the matter like that which existed in the old colonial times, but
they all call themselves simply Filipinos, and that the rule of the
American Anglo-Saxons, who regard even the creoles as a kind of
"niggers," would be looked upon by educated Filipinos of all castes
as a supreme loss of civic rights.&mdash;<i>Translated for the Popular Science

<h2>DO ANIMALS REASON?</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By EDWARD THORNDIKE, Ph. D.</span></p>


<p>Probably every reader who owns a dog or cat has already
answered the question which forms our title, and the chance
is ten to one that he has answered, "Yes." In spite of the declarations
of the psychologists from Descartes to Lloyd Morgan, the man
who likes his dog and the woman who pets a cat persist in the belief
that their pets carry on thinking processes similar, at least in kind,
to our own. And if one has nothing more to say for the opposite
view than the stock arguments of the psychologists, he will make
few converts. A series of experiments carried on for two years
have, I hope, given me some things more to say&mdash;some things which
may interest the believer in reason in animals, even if they do not
convert him.</p>

<p>In trying to find out what sort of thinking animals were capable
of I adopted a novel but very simple method. Dogs and cats were
shut up, when hungry, in inclosures from which they could escape
by performing some simple act, such as pulling a wire loop, stepping
on a platform or lever, clawing down a string stretched across the
inclosure, turning a wooden button, etc. In each case the act set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
in play some simple mechanism which opened the door. A piece
of fish or meat outside the inclosure furnished the motive for their
attempts to escape. The inclosures for the cats were wooden boxes,
in shape and appearance like the one pictured in Fig. 1, and were
about 20 &times; 15 &times; 12 inches in size. The boxes for the dogs (who
were rather small, weighing on the average about thirty pounds)
were about 40 &times; 22 &times; 22. By means of such experiments we put
animals in situations seeming almost sure to call forth any reasoning
powers they possess. On the days when the experiments were
taking place they
were practically
utterly hungry,
and so had the
best reasons for
making every effort
to escape. As
a fact, their conduct
when shut
up in these boxes
showed the utmost
eagerness to
get out and get at
the much-needed
food. Moreover,
the actions required and the thinking involved are such as the stories
told about intelligent animals credit them with, and, on the other
hand, are not far removed from the acts and feelings required in the
ordinary course of animal life. It would be foolish to deny reason to
an animal because he failed to do something (e. g., a mathematical
computation) which in the nature of his life he would never be likely
to think about, or which his bones and muscles were not fitted to perform,
or which, even by those who credit him with reason, he is never
supposed to do. So the experiments were arranged with a view of
giving reasoning every chance to display itself if it existed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo_053_fig1.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="Fig. 1." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></span>
</div>

<p>What, now, would we expect to observe if a <i>reasoning</i> animal,
who is surely eager to get out, is put, for example, into a box with
a door arranged so as to fall open when a wooden button holding it at
the top (on the inside) is turned from its vertical to a horizontal position?
We should expect that he would first try to claw the whole
box apart or to crawl out between the bars. He would soon realize
the futility of this and stop to consider. He might then think of the
button as being the vital point, or of having seen doors open when
buttons were turned. He might then poke or claw it around. If
after he had eaten the bit of fish outside he was immediately put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
the box again he ought to remember what he had done before, and
at once attack the button, and so ever after. It might very well be
that he would not, when in the box for the first time, be able to reason
out the way to escape. But suppose that, in clawing, biting,
trying to crawl through holes, etc., he happened to turn the button
and so escape. He ought, then, if at once put in again, this time to
perform deliberately the act which he had in the first trial hit upon
accidentally. This one would expect to see if the animal <i>did</i> reason.
What do we really see?</p>

<p>To save time we may confine ourselves to a description of the
twelve cats experimented with, adding now that the dogs presented
no difference in behavior which would modify our conclusions. The
behavior of all but No. 11 and No. 13 was practically the same.
When put into the box the cat would show evident signs of discomfort
and of an impulse to escape from confinement. It tries to
squeeze through any opening; it claws and bites at the bars; it
thrusts its paws out through any opening, and claws at everything
it reaches; it continues its efforts when it strikes anything loose
and shaky; it may claw at things in the box. The vigor with which
it struggles is extraordinary. For eight or ten minutes it will claw
and bite and squeeze incessantly. With No. 13, an old cat, and
No. 11, an uncommonly sluggish cat, the behavior was different.
They did not struggle vigorously or continually. (In the experiments
it was found that these two would stay quietly in the box
for hours, and I therefore let them out myself a few times, so that
they might associate the fact of being outside with the fact of eating,
and so desire to escape. When this was done, they tried to get
out like the rest.) In all cases the instinctive struggle is likely to
succeed in leading the cat accidentally to turn the button and so
escape, for the cat claws and bites all over the box. These general
clawings, bitings, and squeezings are of course instinctive, not premeditated.
The cats will do the same if in a box with absolutely
no chance for escape, or in a basket without even an opening&mdash;will
do them, that is, when they are the foolishest things to do. The
cats do these acts for just the same reason that they suck when
young, propagate when older, or eat meat when they smell it.</p>

<p>Each of the twelve cats was tried in a number of different boxes,
and in no case did I see anything that even looked like thoughtful
contemplation of the situation or deliberation over possible ways of
winning freedom. Furthermore, in every case any cat who had
thus accidentally hit upon the proper act was, after he had eaten
the bit of fish outside, immediately put back into the box. Did he
then think of how he had got out before, and at once or after
a time of thinking repeat the act? By no means. He bursts out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
into the same instinctive activities as before, and may even fail this
time to get out at all, or until a much <i>longer</i> period of miscellaneous
scrabbling at last happens to include the particular clawing or poking
which works the mechanism. If one repeats the process, keeps
putting the cat back into the box after each success, the amount
of the useless action
gradually decreases, the
right movement is made
sooner and sooner, until
finally it is done
as soon as the cat is
put in.</p>

<p>This sort of a history
is not the history
of a reasoning animal.
It is the history of an animal who meets a certain situation with a
lot of instinctive acts. Included without design among these acts
is one which brings freedom and food. The pleasurable result of
this one gradually stamps it in in connection with the situation "confinement
in that box," while their failure to result in any pleasure
gradually stamps out all the useless bitings, clawings, and squeezings.
Thus, little by little, the one act becomes more and more
likely to be done in that situation, while the others slowly vanish.
This history represents the wearing smooth of a path in the brain,
not the decisions of a rational consciousness.</p>

</div>

<p>We can express graphically the difference between the conduct
of a reasoning animal and that of these dogs and cats by means of
a time-curve. If, for instance, we let
perpendiculars to a horizontal line
represent each one trial in the box,
and let their heights represent in each
trial the time it took the animal to
escape (each three millimetres equaling
ten seconds), the accompanying
figure (Fig. 2) will tell the story of a
cat which, when first put in, took sixty
seconds to get out; in the second trial,
eighty; in the third, fifty; in the fourth, sixty; in the fifth, fifty;
in the sixth, forty, etc. This figure represents what did actually
happen with one cat in learning a very easy act. Suppose the cat
had, after the third accidental success, been able to reason. She
would then have the next time and in all succeeding times performed
the act as soon as put in, and the figure would have been such as we
see in Fig. 3. The thing is still clearer if, instead of drawing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
perpendiculars, we draw only a line joining their tops. Fig. 4
shows, then, the curve for the real history, and Fig. 5 shows the
abrupt descent, due to a rational comprehension of the situation.
I kept an accurate record of the time, in seconds, taken in every trial
by every cat in every
box, and in them all
there appears no evidence
for the presence
of even the little reasoning
that "what let
me out of this box three
seconds ago will let me
out now." Surely, if
an animal could reason
he would, after ten or eleven accidental successes, think what
he had been doing, and at the eleventh or twelfth trial would at once
perform the act. But no! The slope of the curves, as one may see
in the specimens shown in Fig. 6, is always gradual. So, in saying
that the behavior of the animals throughout the experiments gave
no sign of the presence of reasoning I am not giving a personal
opinion, but the impartial evidence of an unprejudiced watch. The
curves given in Fig. 6 are for cats learning to escape from the box
already described, whose door was held by a wooden button on the
inside.</p>

<p>Some one may object that, true as all this may be, the intelligent
acts reported of animals are in many cases such as could not
have happened in this way by accident. These anecdotes of apparent
comprehension and inference are really the only argument
which the believers in reason have presented. Its whole substance
vanishes if, as a matter of fact, animals
can do these supposed intelligent
acts in the course of instinctive struggling.
They certainly can and do. I
purposely chose, for experiments, two
of the most intelligent performances
described by Romanes in his Animal
Intelligence&mdash;namely, the act of opening
a door by depressing the thumb-piece
of an ordinary thumb-latch and
the opening of a window by turning a swivel (see pp. 420-422 and
p. 425 of Animal Intelligence, by G. J. Romanes). Here I may
quote from the detailed report of my experiments (Monograph Supplement
to the Psychological Review, No. 8):</p>

<p>"G was a box 29 &times; 20-1/2 &times; 22-1/2, with a door 29 &times; 12 hinged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
on the left side of the box (looking from within), and kept closed
by an ordinary thumb-latch placed fifteen inches from the floor. The
remainder of the front of the box was closed in by wooden bars.
The door was a wooden frame covered with screening. It was <i>not</i>
arranged so as to open as soon as the latch was lifted, but required
a force of four hundred grammes, even when applied to the best
advantage. The bar of the thumb-latch, moreover, would fall back
into place again unless the door were pushed out at least a little.
Eight cats (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 13) were, one at a time, left
in this thumb-latch box. All exhibited the customary instinctive
clawings and squeezings and bitings. Out of the eight, <i>all succeeded,
in the course of their vigorous struggles, in pressing down the
thumb-piece</i>, so that if the door had been free to swing open they
could have escaped. Six succeeded in pushing both thumb-piece
down and door out, so that the bar did not fall back
into its place. Of these, <i>five succeeded in also later pushing the
door open, so that they escaped and got the fish outside</i>. Of these,
three, after about fifty trials, associated the complicated movements
required with the sight of the interior of the box so firmly that they
attacked the thumb-latch the moment they were put in."</p>

<p>In the cases of No. 1 and No. 6 the combination of accidents
required was enough to make their successes somewhat rare. Consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
weariness and failure offset the occasional pleasure of getting
food, and after succeeding four and ten times respectively they
never again succeeded, though given numerous opportunities.
Their cases are almost a perfect proof of the claim that accident,
not inference, makes animals open doors. For they hit upon the
thing several times, but did not know enough to profit even by these
experiences, and so failed to open the door the fifth and eleventh
times.</p>

<p>Accident is equally capable of helping a cat escape from an
inclosure whose door is held by a swivel.</p>

<p>"Out of six cats who were put in the box whose door opened
by a button, <i>not one failed</i>, in the course of its impulsive activity,
to push the button around. Sometimes it was clawed one
side from below; sometimes vigorous pressure on the top turned
it around; sometimes it was pushed up by the nose. No cat who
was given repeated trials failed to form a perfect association between
the sight of the interior of that box and the proper movements."</p>

<p>If, then, three cats out of eight can escape from a small box by
accidentally operating a thumb-latch, one cat in a hundred may
easily escape from a room by accident. If one hundred per cent
of all cats are sure to sooner or later turn a button around when
in a small box, one cat in a thousand may well escape from a room
by accidentally turning a swivel around.</p>

<p>So far we have seen that when put in situations calculated to
call forth any thinking powers which they possess, the animal's conduct
still shows no signs of anything beyond the accidental formation
of an association between the sight of the interior of the box
and the impulse to a certain act, and the subsequent complete establishment
of this association because of the power of pleasure to stamp
in any process which leads to it. We have also seen that samples
of the acts which have been supposed by advocates of the reason
theory to require reasoning for their accomplishment turn out to
be readily accomplished by the accidental success of instinctive
impulses. The decision that animals do not possess the higher mental
processes is re-enforced by several other lines of experiment&mdash;for
example, by some experiments on imitation.</p>

<p>The details of these experiments I will not take the time to describe.
Suffice it to say that cats and dogs were given a chance to
see one of their fellows free himself from confinement and gain food
by performing some simple act. In each case they were where they
could see him do this from fifty to one hundred and fifty times, and
did actually watch his actions closely from ten to forty times. After
every ten chances to learn from seeing him, they were put into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
same inclosure and observed carefully, in order to see whether they
would, from having so often seen the act done, know enough to do
it themselves, or at least to try to do it. In this they signally failed.
Those who had failed previously to hit upon the thing accidentally
never learned it later from seeing it done. Those who were given
a chance to imitate acts which accident would sooner or later have
taught them learned the acts no more quickly than if they had never
seen the other animal do it the score or more of times. The animals,
that is, could not master the simple inference that if, in a certain
situation, that fellow-cat of mine performs a certain act and
gets fish, I, in the same situation, may get fish by performing that
act. They did not think enough to profit by the observation of
their fellows, no matter how many chances for such observation were
given them.</p>

<p>Equally corroborative of our first position are the results of still
another set of experiments. Here the dogs and cats were put
through the proper movement from twenty-five to one hundred
times, being left in the box after every five or ten trials and watched
to see if they would not be able at least to realize that the act which
they had just been made to do and which had resulted in liberation
and food was the proper act to be done. For instance, a dog would
be put in a box the door of which would fall open when a loop of
string hanging outside the box was clawed down an inch or so. Animals
were taken who had, when left to themselves, failed to be led
to this particular act by their general instinctive activities. After
two minutes I would put in my arm, take the dog's paw, hold it out
between the bars, and, inserting it in the loop, pull the loop down.
The dog would of course then go out and eat the bit of meat. After
repeating this ten times (in some cases five) I would put the dog in
and leave him to his own devices. If, as was always the case, he
failed in ten or twenty minutes to profit by my teaching I would
take him out, but would not feed him. After a half hour or so I
would recommence my attempts to show the dog what needed to be
done. This would be kept up for two or three days, until he had
shown his utter inability to get the notion of doing for himself what
he had been made to do a hundred or more times. The mental
process required here need not be so high a one as inference or reasoning,
but surely any animal possessing those would, after seeing
and feeling his paw pull a loop down a hundred times with such
good results, have known enough to do it himself. None of my animals
did know enough. Those who did not in ten or twelve trials
hit upon an act by accident could never be taught that act by being
put through it. And, as in the case of imitation, acts of such a sort
as would be surely learned by virtue of accidental success were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
learned a whit sooner or more easily when I thus showed them to
the animal.</p>

<p>An interesting supplement to these facts is found in the following
answers to some questions which I sent to the trainer of one of
the most remarkable trick-performing horses now exhibited on the
stage. The counting tricks done by this horse had been quoted to
me by a friend as impossible of explanation unless the horse could
be educated by being put through the right number of movements
in connection with the different signals.</p>

<p><i>Question 1.</i>&mdash;If you wished to teach a horse to tap seven times
with his hoof when you asked him "How many days are there in a
week?" would you teach him by taking his leg and making him go
through the motions?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;"No!"</p>

<p><i>Question 2.</i>&mdash;Do you think you <i>could</i> teach him that way, even
if naturally you would take some other way?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;"I do not think I could."</p>

<p><i>Question 3.</i>&mdash;How would you teach him?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;"You put figure 2 on the blackboard and <i>touch him,
on the leg</i> twice with a cane, and so on."</p>

<p>The counting tricks of trained horses seem to us marvelous because
we are not acquainted with the simple but important fact that
a horse instinctively raises his hoof when one pricks or taps his leg
in a certain place. Just as once given, the cat's instinct to claw,
squeeze, etc., you can readily get a cat to open doors by working
latches or turning buttons, so, once given this simple reflex of raising
the hoof, you can, by ingenuity and patience, get a horse to do
almost any number of counting tricks.</p>

<p>Probably any one who still feels confident that animals reason
will not be shaken by any further evidence. Still, it will pay any one
who cares to make scientific his notions about animal consciousness
to notice the results of two sets of experiments not yet mentioned.
The first set was concerned with the way animals learn to perform
a compound act. Boxes were arranged so that two or three different
things had to be done before the door would fall open. For instance,
in one case the cat or dog had to step on a platform, reach
up between the bars over the top of the box and claw down a string
running across them, and finally push its paw out beside the door to
claw down a bar which held it.</p>

<p>The animal's instinctive impulses do often lead it to accidentally
perform these several acts one after another, and repeated accidental
successes do in some of these cases cause the acts to be done at
last in fairly quick succession. But we see clearly that the acts are
not thought about or done with anything like a rational comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
of the situation, for the time taken to learn the thing is
much longer than all three elements would take if tackled separately;
and even after the animal has reached a minimum time in
doing the acts, he does not do the things in the same order, and often
repeats one of the acts over and over again, though it has already
attained its end.</p>

<p>The second set comprised experiments on the so-called "memory"
of animals. I will describe only one out of many which agree
with it. A kitten had been trained to the habit of climbing the
wire-netting front of its cage whenever I approached. I then
trained her to climb up at the words "I must feed those cats." This
was done by uttering them and then in ten seconds going up to the
cage and holding a bit of fish to her at its top. After this had been
done about forty times she reached a point where she would climb
up at the signal about fifty per cent of the times. I then introduced
a new element by sometimes saying, "I must feed those cats," as before,
and feeding her, and at other times saying, "I will not feed
them," and remaining still in my chair. At first the kitten felt no
difference, and would climb up just as often at the wrong signal as
at the right. But gradually (it took about four hundred and fifty
trials) the failure to get any pleasure from the act of climbing up
at the wrong signal stamped out the impulse to do so, while the
pleasure sequent upon the act of climbing up at the other signal
made that her invariable response to it. Here, as elsewhere, the
absence of reason was shown by the cat's failure at any point in these
hundreds of trials to think about the matter, and make the easy inference
that one set of sounds meant food, while the other did not.
But still better proof appears in what is to follow. After an interval
of eighty days I tried her again to see how permanent the
association between the signal and act was. It was permanent to
the extent that what took three hundred and eighty trials before
took only fifty this time, for after fifty trials with the "I will not
feed them" signal, mixed up with a lot of the other, the cat once
more attained perfect discrimination. But it was not permanent
in the sense that the cat at the first or tenth or twentieth trial felt,
as a remembering, reasoning consciousness surely ought to feel,
"Why, that lot of sounds means that he won't come up with fish."
For instead of at first forgetting and for a while climbing up at the
<i>I will not feed them</i>, and then remembering its previous experience
and at once stopping the performance it had before learned was useless,
the cat simply went through the same gradual decreasing of
the percentage of wrong responses until finally it always responded
rightly.</p>

<p>What has so far been said is true regardless of any prejudice or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
incompetence on my part, for the proof in all cases rests not on my
observation, but on impartial time records or such matters of fact
as the escape or nonescape, the climbing or not-climbing of the
animals. I may add that in a life among these animals of six months
for from four to eight hours a day I never saw any acts which even
<i>seemed</i> to show reasoning powers, and did see numerous acts unmentioned
here which pointed clearly to their absence.</p>

<p>All that is left for the fond owner of a supposedly rational animal
to say is that though the average animal, the typical dog or cat,
is by these experiments shown to be devoid of reasoning power, yet
<i>his</i> dog or <i>her</i> cat is far above the average level, and is therefore
to be judged by itself. He may claim that just because my average
animals failed to infer, we have no right to deny inference to all,
particularly to his. Is it not fair to ask such a one to repeat my experiments
with his supposedly superior animal? Until he does and
systematically tries to find out how its mind works and what it is
capable of, has he any right to bear witness? It may also be said
that of the number of people who witnessed the performances of
my animals after they had fully learned a lot of these acts, but had
not seen the method of acquisition, all unanimously wondered at
their wonderful intellectual powers. "How <i>do</i> you teach them?"
"Where did you get such bright animals?" "I always thought
animals could think," and such like were common expressions of my
visitors. The fact was that the dogs and cats were picked up in the
street at random, and that no one of them had thought out one jot or
tittle of the things he had learned to do. The specious appearance
of reasoning in a completely formed habit does not involve the presence
or assistance of reasoning in the formation of the habit.</p>

<p>Here, at the close of this account, I may signify my willingness
to reply, so far as is possible, to any letters from readers of the
Popular Science Monthly who may care to ask questions about any
feature of animal intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a discussion of the question "How Education fails," Dr. J. T. Searcy,
of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, speaks of the tendency of too much education as
being to make the pupil too machine-cut. "The successful, the progressive,
the aggressive men, families, and races are not the manufactured
ones, but the self-made ones." In the conditions and complexities of
human society, the accumulating data of knowledge change so rapidly
that educators can not anticipate the future in the elements and curricula
of prescribed education. The advancing man, who is able to keep up in
his day and generation, shows his excellence in his ability to readjust to his
changing environment. The schools can not give this faculty, but rather
have a tendency to weaken it; yet on it, more than anything else, rests the
success of the man and the race. "Too much ought not to be demanded of
the schools, nor ought they to assume too much to themselves."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Hon. CHARLES D. WALCOTT,</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.</span></p>


<p>A national museum should be the center of scientific activity
in the country in which it is located. In England the
British Museum is the Mecca of scientific men. In Paris, Copenhagen,
Vienna, Berlin, and other capitals of Europe the national
museum stands in similar relations to the scientific work of its own
country. Such a relation our National Museum should hold to scientific
men and affairs in America. It should receive and take
care of all material that has been or may be valuable for investigation
or for the illustration of the ethnology, natural history, geology,
products, and resources of our own country, or for comparison
with the material of other countries. It should furnish material
for all kinds of scientific investigations which deal with specimens
or types, and give aid to such researches and publish their results.
It should present by illustration such of the results of the scientific
investigations of its corps of officers as are susceptible of such representation.
It should co-operate with all the higher educational
institutions of learning in the country, and assist in the promotion
and diffusion of knowledge in all lines of investigation carried on
by it. It should provide library facilities, and aid all post-graduate
students who may wish to take advantage of the provisions made by
the Government for scientific research.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">History and Present Organization.</span>&mdash;Beginning in a small way
in the Patent-Office building early in the century, the "Government"
collections of "natural products" were transferred to the
custody of the Smithsonian Institution in 1858, where they were
installed along with the larger and more valuable collections of the
institution. Twenty-three years later, in 1881, the present National
Museum building was ready for the great mass of material
that had accumulated in the Smithsonian building, and had been
transferred from the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. Out
of these heterogeneous collections Dr. G. Brown Goode, under the
direction of Secretary Baird, of the Smithsonian, organized a museum
of broad scope, based on all that had proved best in museum
experience to that time. Faithfully he carried forward the work
until September, 1896, when his health broke under the strain of
too many duties, and one of the best museum administrators the
world has yet produced, if not the very best one, passed from us.
In January, 1897, I was placed in temporary charge of the administration
of the museum as an acting Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, and remained in charge until July 1, 1898.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>On July 1, 1897, in order to meet changed conditions, a new
plan of organization went into effect. The various divisions and
sections of anthropology, biology, and geology, which had previously
been conducted independently of one another, the curators
and custodians reporting directly to the assistant secretary in charge
of the museum, were united under three head curators&mdash;one of anthropology,
another of biology, and a third of geology. This secured
direct expert supervision, and correlated the work of each department.
Before this such correlation had been impossible, owing
to the large number of independent heads of sections and divisions
in each department, who planned and executed the work more or
less independently of one another.</p>

<p>In the department of anthropology the system of installation
inaugurated by Prof. W. H. Holmes is somewhat elaborate. The
primary arrangement is founded, first, on the geographical or ethnographical
assemblage, and, second, on the developmental or genetic
assemblage. Other methods may be classed as special; they are
the chronologic, the comparative, the individual, etc. The primary
methods are adapted to the presentation of the general truths of
anthropology, and the special methods are available for limited
portions of the field.</p>

<p>In many ways the department of biology, under the charge of
Dr. F. W. True, was, at the date named, in much better condition
than either of the other two departments. Many of the zo&ouml;logical
divisions had been in existence since the reorganization of the museum
in 1883, and several of them for a much longer period, and
as the biological specimens had been in charge of curators and assistants
who followed well-defined and long-established methods, the
reorganization of the department was a relatively simple matter,
no radical changes in the scientific methods or in the business administration
being required.</p>

<p>To the organization and administration of the department of
geology, Dr. George P. Merrill brought the results of a recent study
of various European museums. He found it necessary to make a
systematic examination of the written and printed records of the
various Government exploring expeditions and surveys, with a view
to ascertaining what geological material had been collected which
could properly be considered the property of the Government, and
what disposition had been made of the same. The law<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> provides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
that collections made for the Government shall, when no longer
needed for investigations in progress, be deposited in the National
Museum. It was found that this law had not in all cases been
strictly enforced, and that several important collections had not
been transferred to the museum, although some of the earlier exploring
expeditions had passed out of existence, and in several instances
the individuals making the collections had likewise passed
away. This investigation has resulted in the transfer to the museum
of several car loads of specimens no longer needed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The National Museum is unique among permanent museums in
having large sections of its collections almost constantly away from
it. It made displays at London in 1883, at Louisville in 1884, at
Minneapolis in 1887, at Cincinnati and Marietta in 1888, at Madrid
in 1892, at Chicago in 1893, at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in
1896, and at Omaha in 1898. The injury to the museum resulting
from the packing and transportation of specimens and from the
interruption of systematic work and development has been keenly
felt at times by the scientific staff. The advantages have consisted
in showing to the people of many sections of the country what the
museum is doing, in securing collections that otherwise would not
have been obtained, and in extending the educational sphere of
influence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relations to the Smithsonian Institution.</span>&mdash;The museum is a
child that has by its vigorous growth already overshadowed the
parent institution in the extent of its buildings, its expenditures, and
its direct influence upon the people of the United States. In the
larger fields for which the Smithsonian Institution was organized,
for the purpose of increasing and diffusing knowledge among men
throughout the world, the museum is subordinate to the institution,
and if the latter is administered in the future as it has been in the
past, it will continue to hold a unique place among all institutions
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.</p>

<p>In 1877 Prof. Asa Gray, as chairman of a special committee
of the Regents of the Smithsonian, submitted a report which recommended
that a distinction between the institution itself and the museum
under its charge should be made as prominent as possible. The
fear was expressed that if the museum was developed to its full
extent and importance within the Smithsonian Institution it would
absorb the working energies of the institution, and it was thought
that such a differentiation would pave the way to entire separation
of administration or to some other adjustment, as the Board of Regents
might think best or be able to accomplish. Professor Baird,
in 1878, in his report to the regents, called attention to the frequent
mention in the reports of his predecessor of the relations existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
between the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum,
and remarked that "it is only necessary to mention briefly that the
museum constitutes no organic part of the institution, and that,
whenever Congress so directs, it may be transferred to any designated
supervision without affecting the general plans and operations
connected with the 'increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.'"</p>

<p>During the administration of the museum by Dr. Goode, under
the direction of Professor Baird, and later Professor Langley, no
movement was made toward the separation of the museum from the
Smithsonian. On the contrary, Dr. Goode was strongly opposed
to any such action, and in this he was heartily supported by Secretary
Langley. He felt that the result of placing the museum under
the control of one of the great departments of the Government,
or leaving it to be buffeted about in the sea of politics as an independent
organization, would be the destruction of its scientific character.</p>

<p>I have been intimately acquainted with the administration of
the museum since 1886, and less so with the administration of
other scientific bureaus of the Government, one of which, the
Fish Commission, is independent of departmental control. After
a careful reconsideration of the subject of the relations of the National
Museum to the Smithsonian Institution, I have come to the
conclusion that the present welfare and the future development of
the museum will be best served by administrative connection with
the Smithsonian Institution. Under the present organization there
is no necessity for large demand upon the time and energies of the
secretary by the affairs of the museum. If in the future it should
become otherwise, relief could readily be secured by action of the
Board of Regents, requiring the officer in charge of the museum to
report to them through the secretary, much as the various bureaus
of the departments report through their respective secretaries to
Congress. It is not probable, however, that this will become necessary,
for at any time an assistant secretary could be appointed to
take sole charge of the museum, thus relieving the secretary of all
but the most general administrative supervision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relations to a National University.</span>&mdash;A national museum
should radiate an educational influence to the remotest portions of
the country. It should set the standard for all other museums,
whether in public school, academy, college, university, or the larger
museums under municipal and State control. Its influence should
be exercised largely through its publications and through those
who come to study its collections and the methods of work of the
investigators connected directly or indirectly with its scientific staff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
In its library system the student should have access to the literature
bearing upon the subjects with which the museum is concerned.
In its exhibition halls each object should be labeled and arranged
with the view of presenting, by graphic illustration and concise description,
all that it is capable of teaching, either as a discrete object
or as one of a series of objects telling the story of the evolution of
the group to which it belongs. Such a museum is not a place where
the uninformed student may obtain the elements of a university
training; it is an institution where the post-graduate student can
secure access to material for study and research in connection with
men who are carrying forward scientific work of the highest type.
Dr. D. C. Gilman would go further than this. He says:<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"Any person of either sex, from any place, of whatever age,
without any question as to his previous academic degree, should be
admissible; provided, however, that he demonstrate his fitness to
the satisfaction of the leader in the subject of his predilection."</p>

<p>Dr. Gilman thinks that such an organization "may be developed
more readily around the Smithsonian Institution, with less
friction, less expense, less peril, and with the prospect of more permanent
and widespread advantages to the country, than by a dozen
denominational seminaries or one colossal university of the United
States.</p>

<p>"To the special opportunities that the Smithsonian and its affiliations
could offer, every university, at a distance or near by, might
be glad to send its most promising students for a residence of weeks,
months, or years, never losing control of them. Many other persons,
disconnected with universities, but proficient to a considerable
degree in one study or another, would also resort with pleasure
and gratitude, and with prospect of great advantages, to the rare
opportunities which Washington affords for study and investigation
in history, political science, literature, ethnology, anthropology,
medicine, agriculture, meteorology, geology, geodesy, and astronomy."</p>

<p>I fully agree with him, but would make the National Museum
the center of activity, rather than the Smithsonian Institution.
It would then be under the control of the Board of Regents, through
the secretary or the assistant secretary, who could have direct
charge. It seems to me that the function of the Smithsonian Institution
is to aid at the beginning of such a movement, and then
place the administration in charge of one of its bureaus or transfer
it to some other suitable organization.</p>

<p>With the National Museum as a center or base, the student in
Washington may avail himself of the Library of Congress and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
the facilities offered for study and investigation by the various scientific
bureaus of the Government, such as the Fish Commission,
the Zo&ouml;logical Park, the Geological and Coast and Geodetic Surveys,
the Naval Observatory, and the Weather, Botanical, Biological,
and Entomological Bureaus of the Department of Agriculture,
and systematic courses of lectures will place before him the most
advanced ideas and conclusions of the largest body of scientific investigators
in the world.</p>

<p>A single well-trained man, with a few assistants, could render
invaluable aid to hundreds of post-graduate and special students,
whose only need is direction as to the best means of pursuing studies
and investigations. Such an organization could be located in the
administrative building that it has been proposed to erect as a
nucleus of the National University. From this beginning a national
university of the broadest type could be developed with as
much rapidity as the educational interests of the country might
demand.</p>

<p>The National Museum can not at present give facilities to more
than a score of students, but with the erection of a modern museum
building, well equipped with laboratory space and a suitable staff
to conduct the necessary work of installation and investigation, the
scientific side of the National University would be established. It
should be remembered that many of the officers of the scientific
bureaus of the Government are directly connected with the museum
staff as honorary curators and custodians, and that a number of them
have laboratories within the museum building.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Need of a New Building.</span>&mdash;The growth of the United States
National Museum was rapid under the successful administration of
Dr. Goode. When the character of the building and the funds
available for the maintenance of the museum are considered, it
compares favorably with any modern museum. It has received
large collections from the scientific departments of the Government,
by private contribution, by purchase, and by exchange, which have
been accommodated as well as possible in the inadequate laboratories,
storerooms, and exhibition spaces. During the fiscal year
1897-'98, accessions to the number of 1,441 were received, containing
upward of 450,000 specimens&mdash;the largest number for any
one year since the museum was opened. The total number of specimens
recorded to July 1, 1898, exceeds four million. The galleries
just completed have added sixteen thousand square feet of floor
space, which is available for the spreading out and proper exhibition
of material that has previously been crowded in the exhibition
halls and courts on the floor; but, as an illustration of the present
congested conditions, it may be stated that the anthropological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
collections now in the possession of the Government, illustrating the
development and progress of man and his works, if properly placed
on exhibition, would occupy the entire space in the present museum
building. The great collections in biology, botany, economic geology,
general geology, and paleontology should be placed in a building
properly constructed for their study and exhibition. A considerable
portion of the collections are still in the Smithsonian
building, where the crowding is scarcely less than in the museum
building.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the present building there is great deficiency in
laboratory facilities. Curators and assistants are hampered for
want of room in which to lay out, arrange, classify, mount, and
label specimens. There should also be rooms in which students
could bring together and compare various series of objects, and have
at hand books and scientific apparatus. The present museum building
contains a few rooms suitable for the purposes mentioned, but
the majority have to be used as storerooms, laboratories, and offices,
and are therefore too much crowded to serve in any one of these
capacities. Owing to the pressure for space, courts, halls, and galleries
intended for exhibition purposes, both in the Smithsonian
building and in the museum building, are unavoidably occupied to
a considerable extent as laboratories and storerooms. There is
also need of storage room, an increase of the scientific staff, and a
purchasing and collecting fund. The American Museum of Natural
History expends annually $60,000 for the increase of its collections;
the National Museum has from $3,000 to $4,000 for the
purpose.</p>

<p>The immediate and greatest need, however, is a suitable museum
building. The present building is 375 feet square. The space on
the ground floor is 140,625 square feet, and that in the galleries
16,000 square feet; exhibition space, 96,000 square feet. The entire
cost is $315,400.</p>

<p>For comparison with the above figures, the following statistics
relating to the American Museum of Natural History in New York
are given: Total floor space, 294,000 square feet, divided as follows:
Exhibition space, 196,000 square feet; laboratories, library,
etc., 42,500 square feet; workrooms, storage, etc., 42,000 square
feet; lecture hall, 13,500 square feet. These figures include the
portions of the building now being completed. The total cost of
the museum to date, including the completion of the new wings,
is $3,559,470.15. The buildings, and the care of them, are provided
for by the city of New York. The expenses of the scientific
staff, increase of collections, etc. (the income for which for the present
year is approximately $185,000), are defrayed from endowments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
membership fees, and contributions. In the capitals of
Europe, museum buildings are generously provided for.</p>

<p>The National Museum building was erected with the view of
covering the largest amount of space with the least outlay of money.
In this respect it may be considered a success. It is, in fact, scarcely
more than the shadow of such a massive, dignified, and well-finished
building as should be the home of the great national collections.
There is needed at once a spacious, absolutely fireproof building of
several stories, constructed of durable materials, well lighted, modern
in equipment, and on such a plan that it can be added to as
occasion arises in the future. The site for such a building is already
owned by the Government; only the building needs to be provided
for. What the Capitol building is to the nation, the library
building to the National Library, the Smithsonian building to the
Smithsonian Institution, the new museum building should be to
the National Museum. There should be available:</p>

four directions: (1) The occupation of the present building by the
anthropological collections; (2) the housing, developing, and installing
of the large biological collections; (3) the development of
a great museum of practical geology; and (4) the development of
the scientific side of a National University.</p>

<p>1. The collections in anthropology, as they stand to-day, cover
a wide field in a broken and disconnected way. It is difficult to use
them effectively to illustrate the great features of this branch of
science. They do not present a connected story of the peoples and
cultures of the world. This arises from the gaps in the collections
and the absence of suitable laboratory and exhibition space. This
department should have adequate representations of the American
peoples and their culture, not only of our own country, but of the
whole American continent. Our nation is the only one in America
that can reasonably be expected to do anything of importance toward
the preservation of the materials necessary for the illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
of this vast field; and as the American race is a unit, of which the
tribes in our own territory constitute a considerable part, it appears
to be our duty to take up this work in a comprehensive way. Thus
would be built up not only a National Museum, but an American
Museum in the widest sense. This applies not only to anthropology,
but to the other great departments of the museum. It will be impossible
to carry on such a work without turning over to the Department
of Anthropology the entire present building, with all
its laboratory and exhibition space.</p>

<p>2. The Department of Biology now occupies a large exhibition
space in the Smithsonian building and 55,000 square feet in the
museum building. Large collections are stored in laboratories and
inclosed spaces in the exhibition halls which would be placed on
exhibition if space were available. As has already been explained,
in a new building there should be available for the Department of
Biology 190,000 square feet of exhibition, laboratory, and storage
space.</p>

<p>The present exhibit is more complete than that of the other departments
of the museum. Of birds there is a large mounted series,
one of the finest in existence, but it is so indifferently housed that
it fails to make the impression it should. Of mammals there is a
good North American series, and there are some excellent examples
of exotic species. There is a good and rather large exhibit of
the various groups of the lower forms of animals, including an especially
fine series of corals and sponges. These are the only series
at present exhibited which can be considered at all comprehensive.
Of the great groups of fishes, reptiles, and amphibians there is room
only for an outline representation. The wonderful variety of form
among insects can be scarcely more than suggested in the space
available. Of plants there has hitherto been no exhibit worthy of
the name, and the space which it has now been possible to set aside
is entirely out of proportion to the vast extent and importance of
this great kingdom of Nature.</p>

<p>Every natural-history museum of the first class should have at
least two comprehensive exhibition series. The first, the <i>Systematic
Series</i>, is a series representing the natural groups, among which
all animals and plants, from the highest to the lowest, are divided.
The second, the <i>Faunal and Floral Series</i>, is a series showing the
animals and plants characteristic of each of the grand divisions of
the earth's surface, which naturalists have established as a result
of their study of these two kingdoms of Nature. These two great
comprehensive exhibits should be supplemented by a number of
<i>Special Series</i>, illustrating the more interesting phenomena and
phases of life, such as the macroscopic and microscopic structure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
animals and plants and their development from the germ to the
fully adult individual, and special modifications of form and color
by which animals are protected from their enemies; the adaptations
for peculiar environments and modes of life; the characteristics
of youth, maturity, and old age; the variation in form, size,
and color among individuals of the same species; the domiciles and
other works constructed by birds, mammals, insects, and the like.
To these series should be added another of great importance, the
<i>Economic Series</i>, representing the animals and plants as related to
the activities and needs of man. Any one of these principal series
in its full development would more than fill the entire space now
available.</p>

<p>3. There should be developed a museum of practical geology
in the broadest sense, which will be of service to every producer
and consumer of American mineral products, and to all students of
geology who are engaged in either economic or purely scientific investigations.</p>

<p>In addition to the series of rocks and fossils illustrating the
stratigraphy and succession of the sedimentary rocks and the systematic
collection of minerals and ores, an exhibit showing how geologic
work benefits the daily life of the people should be developed.
An illustration of this would be a representation of the artesian-water
supply of the semi-arid region, showing the stratification and
structure of the sedimentary rocks, and how hydrographic and geologic
investigations clearly indicate the regions in which artesian-water
development may be carried on successfully. Mining and
areal geology could also be illustrated in such manner as to place
before the student and intelligent observer the import and value
of such work.</p>

<p>In most museums the principal effort has been to make a collection
of useful mineral products. This is desirable, but, from the
broad view of illustrating the practical in addition to the scientific
side of geology, it should be secondary. The best basis for classification
on the practical side of the museum exhibit appears to be
the finished mineral product. For instance, if pig iron be taken
as a key material in classification, the iron ores from which it has
been obtained should be arranged so as to show the various kinds
whose combination has resulted in the pig iron. In connection
with this should be grouped the geologic phenomena, which
should include any geologic conditions connected with the original
deposition and the occurrence of iron ores. This might include
the conditions which have led to the oxidation of pyrite and
other sulphur compounds of iron, and to the development of hydrous
oxides of iron; also an illustration of what has been demonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
in regard to the solution of widely distributed minerals in certain
rocks, and their subsequent concentration in ore bodies by metasomatic
action. All the metals could be arranged under such a classification,
as also the nonmetallic products. The preparation of
such an exhibit would require many years of work, the details of
which would be considered as each mineral product was taken in
hand.</p>

<p>4. The fourth direction of development is toward the requirements
of a National University, which has already been sufficiently
dwelt upon in this connection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children's Museum.</span>&mdash;The children gain a fair amount of information
from the general exhibit in any well-arranged museum,
but it is desirable that their interest should be aroused by having
certain exhibits made expressly for them. I would have a space
set aside in each of the three departments in which nothing should
be exhibited except for the children. It might be called a Museum
Kindergarten.</p>

<p>Some of the preceding suggestions have been adopted by the
museum authorities and partially put into execution, and the carrying
of them out is dependent upon enlarged facilities for laboratory
work and exhibition space. During the administration of Dr.
Goode the museum developed as far as possible under the conditions
surrounding it. No one knew better than he that only by
securing new buildings and expanding the museum could it take the
place in America that the several national museums of Europe have
taken in their respective countries. It is well recognized that a
public museum is a necessity in every highly civilized community,
and that, as has been so well stated by Dr. Goode, "the degree of
civilization which any nation, city, or province has attained is best
shown by the character of its public museums and the liberality
with which they are maintained." At present New York city is,
in this respect, in advance of all other American cities and of the
national Government. Whether the latter will take its proper
place by developing the National Museum as it has developed
the National Library remains to be seen. The question whether
they are willing to be represented by the museum as it is to-day
is one that the American people should consider and decide
at an early date; meantime, it is the duty of all interested in
the advancement of science and education to aid by every means
in their power the development of a National Museum that will
be truly national and American.</p>

<h2>ARE JEWS JEWS?</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By JOSEPH JACOBS,</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">PRESIDENT OF THE JEWISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</span></p>


<p>In the December (1898) and January (1899) numbers of Appletons'
Popular Science Monthly Prof. William Z. Ripley concludes
the remarkable series of articles on the Racial Geography of
Europe, originally delivered as Lowell Institute lectures, by a couple
of articles on the Jews. Strictly speaking, the articles might seem
to have no right in the particular series in which Professor Ripley
has included them, since their main object is to show that the Jews
are not a race but a people, and have therefore no claim to be considered
in the racial geography of any continent. But one can not
regret that a daring disregard for logic has caused Professor Ripley
to conclude his interesting series with the somewhat startling paradox
that Jews are not Jews, in the sense of the word in which both
their friends and their enemies have hitherto taken it. As Professor
Ripley has been good enough to refer to me as having written
with some authority on the subject, and as I have not been convinced
by his arguments against the comparative racial purity of the
Jews, I am glad of an opportunity to discuss the question, which is
of equal theoretic and practical interest.</p>

<p>The theoretic interest, with which alone we need concern ourselves
here, seems to me of two kinds. Professor Ripley, as a student
of anthropology, declares, as the result of his inquiries, that
there has been so large an admixture of round skulls with the (hypothetically
assumed) original long skulls of the Hebrews that all
signs of racial unity have disappeared. I, on the other hand, who
have approached the subject as a student of history,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> see no evidence
of any such large admixture of alien elements in the race
since its dispersion from Palestine, and have come, therefore, to
the opposite conclusion&mdash;that the Jews now living are, to all intents
and purposes, exclusively the direct descendants of the Diaspora.
Here, then, anthropology and history&mdash;if Professor Ripley and I
have respectively interpreted their verdicts aright&mdash;appear to speak
in two opposite senses, and no conference at La Hague or elsewhere
can appoint a court of appeal which can decide between contrary
propositions by two different sciences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>
<p>But the point in discussion seems to me to raise also a problem
of exceeding interest within the anthropological sphere itself. Professor
Ripley assumes that round heads beget round heads, and
long heads descend from long heads for all time unchanged. That
appears to carry with it the assumption that no amount of brain
activity can increase the mass of brain, that skull capacity has no
relation to mental capacity, and that alone among the organs of the
body the brain and skull are incapable of growth, change, or development.
The <i>crux</i> of Jewish anthropology raises this problem, as
I shall proceed to show, and, if I have interpreted history aright,
offers valuable material toward its solution.</p>

<p>I might have met Professor Ripley's arguments on narrower
grounds, which would have enabled me to evade this larger question.
His main, I might say his solitary, argument is that contemporary
Jews are predominantly brachycephalic, or round-headed,
whereas contemporary Arabs, whom he takes as the type of the
Semites, are as predominantly dolichocephalic, or long-headed. Accepting
Professor Ripley's own criterion of purity of race, I might
point to the almost universal round-headedness of the Jew as a
proof of their racial unity. The fact that Arabs do not share that
quality really does not affect the question. Linguistically and geographically
the Hebrews of history were associated with the Aram&aelig;ans
and Assyrians of Asia Minor, and Professor Ripley himself
allows that Asia Minor was mainly brachycephalic. Till Professor
Ripley brings forward craniological evidence that the cephalic index
of the ancient Hebrews was below 77.8, his reference to the contemporary
Arab must be ruled out of court. But, quite apart from this,
the Arabic evidence would be of little significance, since the chief
characteristic of Moslem civilization has been the predominance of
marriage by capture and descent from slave concubines. Every caravan
that has entered Arabia for the last twelve hundred years has
had its contingent of female slaves of alien race, mainly from dolichocephalic
Africa. I must confess my surprise that Professor
Ripley has based his main argument on the shifting sands of Arabic
racial purity.</p>

<p>The only attempt Professor Ripley makes toward a proof that
the pure Hebrew is dolichocephalic is a half-hearted endeavor to
claim that quality for the Sephardim, or Spanish and Portuguese
Jews, descended in the main from Jewish refugees from Spain and
Portugal in 1492. As a matter of fact, the largest number of measurements
of Sephardic heads has been made by Mr. Spielman and
myself,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and of the fifty-one heads examined by us only eight were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
long-headed. Professor Ripley gives a portrait of a Tunisian Jew,
with index 75, who is also probably of Sephardic origin, like most
of the Jews of the Mediterranean littoral. But, curiously enough,
there is far more evidence for the mixture of race among contemporary
Sephardim than of any other branch of Jews. Even while
they were living in Spain as avowed Jews they were persistently accused
of intermarriage, chiefly with the Moors, while a large number
of contemporary Sephardim are descended not from refugees
of 1492, but from the so-called Marranos&mdash;Jews who remained in
Spain, professing Christianity and marrying tolerably freely among
the surrounding population. If one wished to be hypercritical,
one could trace the long-headedness of a minority of Jews to this
admixture of race from Spain.</p>

<p>After all, I must insist that it is to history one must go to determine
a question of this sort. Jews have shown such marked individuality
throughout their career for the last two thousand years
among the nations&mdash;they have been so much in the world's eye
throughout that time&mdash;that any appreciable degree of intermarriage
would not have escaped notice, both by themselves and by
their enemies. Now there is practically no evidence of this kind
during the Christian era. Religious antipathy has been so strong
throughout that period as to form an almost insurmountable barrier
to intermarriage and the consequent proselytism to Judaism which
is necessary for a valid Jewish marriage. Sporadic cases doubtless
occur, but their very infrequency drew attention to them, and
all that historical research can discover is under one hundred cases
throughout the middle ages, scattered through Europe. Jewish
nomenclature has special formul&aelig; to name the proselyte, and yet,
though we have hundreds of the medi&aelig;val lists of Jewish communities
and martyrologies, it is the rarest thing in the world to find
one of these names referred to as "sons (or daughters) of Abraham
our father." In earlier days, doctors of the Talmud, when discussing
hypothetical cases, dismissed that of the proselyte as being
so rare.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In my Memoir in the Journal of the Anthropological
Institute for 1885 I have taken the marriage statistics of modern
Algeria as most nearly representing the most favorable conditions
that one could imagine at any time during the middle ages, and
have found that during nearly half a century (1830-'77) there
were only thirty mixed marriages out of an average population of
twenty-five thousand Jews&mdash;not one a year. The only instances of
proselytism on a large scale are those of the Chozars in southern
Russia, converted to Judaism in the eighth century, and the Falashas
of Abyssinia, about the same time. Yet these are an indirect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
proof, by the method of difference, of the comparatively pure descent
of the rest of the Jews, for neither the Karaites, who are the descendants
of the Chozars, nor the Falashas show any of the characteristic
Jewish features or expression.</p>

<p>Those who contest the purity of the Jewish race lay great stress
upon the Chozars as forming the nucleus of the Russian Polish
Jews, who are, as is well known, a predominant majority among
present-day Jews, probably ninety per cent of whom either dwell
in the Russian dominions or are descended from former inhabitants
of old Poland. Yet against this is the absence of any reference
to Jews in Poland during the time the Chozars flourished (eighth
to eleventh centuries), while the very speech of the Polish Jews&mdash;the
so-called "Yiddish," really archaic German mixed with Hebrew&mdash;indicates
their true source, the German kingdoms and principalities.
Professor Ripley throws some doubt upon the possibility
of such large numbers as those of the Polish Jews having
been derived from Germany. Nowadays there are probably five
millions of Jews in the regions once possessed by Poland, but the
remarkable fertility of Jews is one of the most striking characteristics
of their vital statistics, to which, indeed, Professor Ripley has
called attention in his remarks upon their vitality. The development
of a generation depends, as is well known, upon the relative
number of deaths under five years of age, and it is just at this period
that Jewish mortality presents so favorable an aspect, owing to the
care of Jewish mothers and the absence of alcoholism among the
fathers. I have estimated that the Jewish population of the world
in 1730 (six generations ago) was only 1,300,000, whereas at the
present moment it is at least nine times as much. If one could
assume the same rate of progress to have existed through the middle
ages the Jewish population in the fourteenth century would have
been not much more than 25,000. Such a rate of progress is, however,
extremely unlikely, considering the large losses by persecution,
which in Poland alone, during the disastrous Cossack inroads
between 1648 and 1656, is said to have removed no less than
180,000 Jews. But, making every allowance for this disturbance
in the rate of progress, it would have been quite possible for 50,000
Jews who had migrated to Poland in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries to increase to over half a million at the beginning of the
eighteenth. Americans, who have seen nearly half a million Russian
Jews land upon their shores within the last twenty years after
crossing nearly half the world, need not be incredulous as to the possibility
of one tenth of that number passing over the borders between
Germany and Poland in a couple of centuries during the middle
ages, when, if means of transit were less numerous, intensity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
persecution and motives for emigration were ten times as strong
as even under the iron rule of the Russian Czar.</p>

<p>History, then, as I read it, has nothing to say against the purity
of descent of contemporary Jews from those of the Bible. What
has anthropology, as interpreted by Professor Ripley, to produce
against this negative evidence of history? Mainly, it would appear,
the fact that Jews of the present day are predominantly brachycephalic.
Of the fact there can be little doubt. The list given
by Professor Ripley in the Popular Science Monthly (vol. liv, page
340), of over twenty-five hundred heads, would be sufficient to
establish this. But the very uniformity of the index is almost sufficient
by itself to refute the deduction Professor Ripley draws from
it. If there had been any general amount of admixture, that would
have tended rather to produce variety than uniformity. Surely
Professor Ripley does not contend that the Jewish young men and
maidens, who, on his theory, so freely welcomed outsiders into the
family circle, have never fallen in love with long-headed persons of
the opposite sex. His argument requires that the original Jews of
the Diaspora were long-headed, and that they have uniformly intermarried
with the broad-headed varieties of the genus <i>homo</i>. Now,
he adduces no evidence whatever that Jews originally were dolichocephalic,
and even if he succeeded in proving this he would have the
further difficulty of finding a European race with skulls so broad
as to raise the average index of the race considerably over 80. If
we assume that the original index of the Jewish skull was 75, Professor
Ripley would have to find some race with an average index
of nearly 90 before the mixture would raise the contemporary Jewish
skull to its present broad-headedness. Dr. Ammon has shown<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
that there are only two small regions in Europe where such abnormally
broad skulls exist, neither of them centers of Jewish population.</p>

<p>But Dr. Ammon has shown more. By comparison with the
skulls found in the long barrows in Germany, he shows that the
index of German skulls has risen from 77 to no less than 83 during
the last thousand years or so; and he further shows, by reasoning
similar to that which I have just given, that this rise in index can
not be due to any admixture of race. Now, to what is this rise in
head index due? Dr. Ammon, who is a professed disciple of Weismann,
does not go into the question of causation, but the simplest
and most obvious explanation is that cranial capacity has followed
brain development, and that, roughly speaking, brachycephalism
implies intellectual development. A few instances may be given,
confirming this impression of the superior intellectual capacity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
the broad-headed. Prof. Karl Pearson, in his Chances of Death
(vol. i, page 205), has given the following sexual ratios of the superiority
of English, German, and French men over the opposite sex:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="sexual ratios of the superiority of men over the opposite sex">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>English.</td><td>German.</td><td>French.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Brain weight</td><td>1.120</td><td>1.117</td><td>1.125</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Skull capacity</td><td>1.179</td><td>1.126</td><td>1.164</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Stature</td><td>1.081</td><td>1.078</td><td>1.069</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In other words, men's skulls contain about eight per cent more and
their brains weigh four per cent more than women's, even allowing
for the difference in height. So, too, there is a uniform increase
of cubic capacity from the skulls of the Australians (75 cubic centimetres)
up to the Teutons (93.5 cubic centimetres).<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The same
authority gives the average weight of brain in a number of brachycephalic
individuals as 1,314 grammes, as against 1,287 grammes
for dolichocephalic cases.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Professor Pearson points out that the
higher the caste in India the broader the skull, the Brahmans being
highest, with an index of 78.86, according to the measurements of
Risley. The same writer gives a long list (page 290) of the indexes
of skulls of some thirty-seven races, ranging from Australians
at the bottom of the list, with 70.34, and headed by medi&aelig;val Jews
(only twelve skulls), with an index of 84.74. Every indication
seems to point out that in races where progress depends upon brain
rather than muscle the brain-box broadens out as a natural consequence.
Little investigation has as yet been made as to the influence
of brain development on the form of the skull, but what little
has been done all points in the same direction. Dr. Giulio Chiarugi<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
has made some careful measurements of twenty-one brains,
and has shown that in every instance there is much greater complexity
of the cerebral convolutions in the brachycephalic as compared
with the dolichocephalic skulls, in which the brains were contained.
From the nature of the sutures of the skull it is tolerably
obvious that if brain capacity produces an enlargement of brain,
the consequent internal pressure on the skull will be lateral and
tend to produce brachycephalism. The application of all this to
the case of Jews seems obvious. If they had been forced by persecution
to become mainly blacksmiths, one would not have been surprised
to find their biceps larger than those of other folk; and similarly,
as they have been forced to live by the exercise of their brains,
one should not be surprised to find the cubic capacity of their skulls
larger than that of their neighbors. When it is remembered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
they are, owing to their persecutions, the shortest of all European
folk, their relative superiority in brain comes out even more strikingly.</p>

<p>The conclusion I have thus drawn from anthropological data
receives remarkable confirmation from the results of an inquiry I
made on the Comparative Distribution of Jewish Ability, and contributed
to the Anthropological Institute in 1886. Applying the
methods of Galton, I compared the celebrities produced by the
Jewish race during the last hundred years with those of Englishmen
and Scotchmen, and came to the conclusion that the race, as a
whole, took rank between Scotchmen and Englishmen in intellectual
capacity, while if the comparison had been confined to western
Jews, who alone have had an opportunity of displaying their talents,
they would have come out superior to both. From the anthropological
side we should expect that the brachycephalism of
Jews would show itself in superior mental capacity, and this is confirmed
by the number of distinguished persons of Jewish blood recorded
in the European dictionaries of biography.</p>

<p>The anthropological and sociological importance of this result,
if confirmed by further inquiry, seems to me of very great significance
for the science of anthropology, and for this reason I have
insisted so much upon it. Skull capacity and cephalic index are
not so much indications of race as of intellect. If it is found that,
as a rule, each race, and even each people, tends to have a uniform
cephalic index, that would merely imply that the sociological conditions
of the said race or people were tolerably uniform as regards
intellectual development. Australians, who have had no opportunity
of pitting their wits against any other competing race, and
have depended for their existence on the fleetness of their legs and
the capacity of their stomachs to carry food from one orgy to another,
have used their brains less than all other human races, and
have the narrowest skulls of all. Teutons, who have had the largest
sphere for intellectual rivalry with their neighbors, have the
broadest skulls of all except the Jews, who have, so to speak, lived
by their wits the last two thousand years. The evidence produced
by Professor Ripley of long-headed Jews among the lower developed
communities only shows that where the brain is not much exercised
the skull is not broadened.</p>

<p>So far, then, from history and anthropology giving contrary
verdicts with regard to the racial purity of the Jews, the above
considerations would seem to show that they rather confirm one
another's interpretation of the facts. If brain capacity and skull
index follow the intellectual struggle for existence, we should not
be surprised to find the Jews mostly broad-headed. If there had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
been much intermixture with races who had less cause to exercise
their brains in the struggle for existence, we might expect a greater
admixture of dolichocephalism among them. To my mind a much
stronger case could have been made out for the admixture of the
Jews by the large number of blondes among them, ranging to about
twenty per cent, but, as a rule, in Europe blond types are dolichocephalic,
and the evidence of admixture that could be drawn from
the admixture of blue eyes or brown hair among the Jews is counterbalanced
by that very evidence of their uniform round-headedness,
upon which Professor Ripley lays so much stress. In the
memoir I have frequently quoted I have given reasons for believing
that there was a blond as well as a brunette type among the
ancient Jews, and till evidence is shown to the contrary the presence
of the fair Jew is only an indication of descent from the earlier
blond strain of the race.</p>

<p>Professor Ripley has scarcely taken into account the more positive
arguments I have adduced in my memoir for the comparative
purity of Jewish descent. I have pointed out a definite class of
Jews&mdash;the Cohens, or priestly descendants of Aaron&mdash;who can not,
according to Jewish law, marry proselytes. These still constitute,
I have calculated, some five per cent of Jews even at the present
day. He appears to think that this is merely a matter of name, and
asks how I would explain the existence of quasi-Jewish names, such
as Davis, Harris, Phillips, and Hart, among Christian populations of
the Anglo-Saxon world. As a matter of fact, it can be proved that,
on the contrary, these names among the Jews have been adopted for
"mimicry" reasons from the corresponding Christian names which
are mostly derived from the Bible. But, at the best, Professor Ripley's
argument would merely prove a certain amount of Jewish
blood among the Christian populations of Europe and America,
which nobody would deny. That Jews, under the pressure of persecution
or for other reasons, have abjured their faith, married
Christian wives, and become merged in the surrounding populations,
is undoubtedly a fact, but does not in any way affect the relative
purity of the "remnant" which has remained true to its faith. It
certainly does not affect the very important fact that the ancestry
of at least five per cent of Jews at the present day can not have married
proselytes, owing to the rigid requirements of Jewish law.</p>

<p>So far as I understand the latter part of Professor Ripley's second
article, he appears to contend that the remarkable similarity
of the Jewish physiognomy all over the world has no force in proving
their racial unity. This is, of course, from the popular point of
view, the strongest argument which Professor Ripley has to meet.
Speaking generally, one can always tell a Jew or Jewess by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
Jewish features and expression. So marked is this that Andr&eacute;e
mentions an instance where the negroes of the Gold Coast even distinguish
between other whites and Jews by its means, saying not
"Here are three whites coming," but "Here are two whites and a
Jew." So marked a community of expression and appearance would
be, to an ordinary mind, an absolute proof of unity of race, but
Professor Ripley prefers to judge by the skull beneath, rather than by
the expression and features on the surface. He hints at some obscure
embryological process by which Jewish mothers can stamp
on their offspring the Ghetto expression, whatever be the racial
formation of skull. According to him, it would appear that noses
are more plastic in this regard than skulls. I do not quite see how
this would work out in detail. Are we to suppose that a pair of
snub-nosed converts to Judaism would produce offspring with the
characteristic Jewish nose because the lady convert had her imagination
influenced by the hook-noses surrounding her? Are we to
suppose that round heads can only beget round heads, but that
snub noses can produce the hooked variety as a mere result of imagination?</p>

<p>Mere expression one could understand could be produced by
sociological causes, and it is certainly my impression that Jews who
mix more with their fellow-citizens lose a good deal of the characteristic
Jewish expression, but that Jewish features should be influenced
in this way few people would be prepared to allow. Jewish
"nostrility," as I have termed it, and the "Jew's eye," can not
be affected by change of environment. They can be affected, I
grant, by admixture with races snub-nosed or dull-eyed, but as they
have persisted throughout the ages they are themselves a striking
proof of the absence of such admixture.</p>

<p>Altogether I remain unconvinced by Professor Ripley's arguments
as to any large admixture of alien elements among contemporary
Jews as unvouched for by history, and not necessarily postulated
by anthropology. The broad skulls of the Jews, if they differ
from those of earlier date (of which Professor Ripley has produced
no evidence whatever), are due to the development of Jewish capacity,
owing to their consistent attention to education and to the
conditions under which they have pursued the struggle for existence.
The persistence of Jewish features throughout the ages and the existence
of an influential minority who are not allowed by Jewish law
to marry outside their race is further proof of the position for which
I have throughout contended. If there has been a tolerably large
admixture of Jewish and alien blood throughout the Christian centuries
it has been by conversions to Christianity or Islam, not by
adoption of Judaism, and it is confirmed by history that the offspring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
have wandered away from the Jewish race and have not affected the
more conservative remnant.</p>

<p>The significance of this result for the science of anthropology
can not be overrated. The great question of the science is that
expressed by Dr. Galton as "the struggle between Nature and nurture"&mdash;the
difference that social influences can produce on men of
the same race. Jews afford the science almost the sole instance in
which this problem can be studied in its least complex form. My
own investigations have shown that social environment has a direct
influence on such anthropometrical data as height and breathing capacity.
The Jews of the West End of London, though of the same
race as those of the East End, are superior in height and other external
qualities, and this superiority can thus be shown to be due entirely
to nurture. Similarly, if the argument I have previously
adduced is correct, the brachycephalism of the Jew is a proof that
intellectual development produces broad heads, and that, roughly
speaking, the cephalic index is a key to intellectual capacity. I
should rather reverse Professor Ripley's main contentions: breadth
of skull is not a criterion of race, but of intellectual development;
whereas features, which are not directly influenced by social or intellectual
characteristics, are the true index to racial purity.</p>

<h2>SOME PRACTICAL PHASES OF MENTAL FATIGUE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Prof. M. V. O'SHEA.</span></p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Modern studies in neurology have contributed much to our
knowledge of the function of the nervous system as a whole
and of its several parts, and also of the relation of psychical activity
to cerebral conditions and processes. The architecture of the neural
mechanism delineated by these investigations is not only interesting
in itself on account of the marvelous unity of things apparently
diverse, but it is at the same time suggestive respecting its
office as the physical instrument through which mind must express
itself in this world. Psychologists now quite generally conceive of a
living being, human or otherwise, as a reacting organism, receiving
impressions from its environment and responding to them in some
characteristic manner. To be fitted for this office an individual must
be provided with appliances alike for the reception of stimulations
and for their transformation into incitements to muscular activity.
In the human species Nature has ordained that action need not follow
immediately and inevitably upon any sense stimulus; fortunately,
it may be deferred, so that when it does finally occur it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
will be the resultant of any given present impression modified by
others previously received and treasured up in memory, as we say.
To accomplish this really great feat, Nature had to devise an elaborate
contrivance, interposed between incoming messages and outgoing
impulses, to act as a moderator or transformer of a very extraordinary
and intricate character&mdash;the central nervous system,
comprising the brain and spinal cord. That it may be able to meet
the requirements of its office, this system must be equipped with two
principal kinds of apparatus&mdash;cells, which will serve as storehouses
of energy to be employed in keeping the machinery running, and
association fibers or pathways, which will put any one cell into communication
with others in the cerebral community.</p>

<p>The item which will engage our attention principally here relates
to the primary function of the nerve cell&mdash;to store up vital
forces in the form of highly unstable chemical compounds,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which
may upon slight disturbance be broken down, the static energy represented
in their union thus becoming dynamic. Those who have
given special attention to the matter seem to agree that all activity,
physical as well as mental, involves the expenditure of a portion of
this energy.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It may perhaps be mentioned in passing that when
this conception was first being presented some persons hastily constructed
the theory that what people had been calling mind was
nothing more nor less than a certain mode of manifestation of this
mysterious but yet physical force. While abundant evidence,
gained from various sciences by recent research, leads one to the conviction
that in some unknown manner psychical and neural processes
are closely co-ordinated, yet not a single investigator of standing
claims that they are identical. There is doubtless among some in
our day too great a tendency, unconscious though it may be for the
most part, to declare that a description of the physical correlates
or antecedents of mental phenomena fully accounts for the latter
in respect alike of their nature and their modes of manifestation;
but those who find themselves coming to such conclusions might be
both interested in and benefited by examining the opinions of great
naturalists and psychologists who have reflected long and profoundly
upon the world-old problem of the connections between body and
mind&mdash;such men as Lotze,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Darwin,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Romanes,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Wallace,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Fiske,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Drummond,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Wundt,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and many others of equal scientific attainments.</p>

<p>The architecture and chemical constitution of the neural elements
indicate unmistakably, it seems, that they were so constructed
that in their functioning they would be amenable to the law of the
conservation of energy, and recent investigations have produced
some experimental evidence in support of this view. Hodge,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> who
succeeded in making microscopical examinations of living nerve
cells while under stimulation, demonstrated that the cell by this
treatment was depleted of its contents, as revealed in the gradual reduction
of its size. In corroboration of these results it was found
that the cerebral cells in animals were larger in the morning than
after a day's activities, indicating that depletion must have taken
place during waking life, followed by recuperation in sleep. Some
interesting data relating in a way to this matter are easily gained
in the laboratories by the use of the plethysmograph, which is designed
to record the degree of blood pressure in different parts of
the body. This instrument may be put upon the wrists and head,
for instance, and it may be observed, when a person is subjected to
certain influences whether, there is any alteration in blood supply in
either region. It may be noticed, as a matter of fact, that when one
is required to think diligently upon any problem, or being asleep is
awakened or even disturbed by a noise in his environment, the volume
of blood decreases in the wrist and increases in the head.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
This same phenomenon is shown by experiments with the scientific
cradle.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The inference from these data seems reasonable, that
mental activity causes an expenditure of nerve force, which Nature
seeks to replenish by inciting an unusual flow of nutritive-bearing
fluid to the cerebral cortex. It has been shown, in further illustration
of this law, that thought increases the temperature of the head,
indicating that heat is generated through molecular activity; and
also that psychical action increases waste products in the system,
which may be derived only from the degradation of substances in
nerve cells.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> So information obtained from various other sources
points toward the conclusion that in all activity energy stored in
nerve cells is dissipated.</p>

<p>Recent experimental studies have given us reasons for believing
that nerve cells in different individuals yield up their energy
in response to stimulation with varying degrees of readiness.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
corroborates what Professor Bryan<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> has said: that some
persons possess a leaky nervous system, wherefrom their vitalities
flow away without issue in useful results. In such individuals activity
will be likely to be in excess of that which the stimulus occasioning
it should normally produce. Every one must have seen
children, and adults as well, who when they hear a slight noise, for
instance, which others do not mind, react with great vigor by jumping
or screaming; or, when spoken to unexpectedly the face flushes,
the lip quivers, and they become physically uncontrolled in a measure.
In these instances the persons are unduly profligate in the
expenditure of their means, and, in consequence, their capital is
relatively soon exhausted.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The writer last year conducted some experiments upon school
children which yielded results that appear to confirm the view here
set forth. Scripture's steadiness gauge was used in one test. This
is designed to investigate stability of control by requiring a person
to direct a light rod under guidance of the eye upon a point several
feet distant, failure to accomplish this being announced by the ringing
of an electric bell. The subject is usually required to make the
trial fifteen times at a single test, and the number of successful
attempts is taken to be in a way, although not always reliable, an
index to his power of co-ordination. But more important than the
success or failure in accomplishing the task is the index it affords of
the nervous condition of the subject as revealed in the expressions
of face and body. Tests were made in the morning, shortly following
the opening of school, and again at half past eleven o'clock, or
thereabouts, after the pupils had been working over their lessons
for about two hours. One boy of eleven years, A. M., is a fair illustration
of what might not inappropriately be called an exhaustive
type, wherein nervous energy is readily depleted because of incessant
waste. In the morning tests he was well controlled and accurate.
A record of five tests made at half past eleven all show that
after four or five attempts to place the rod upon the point the hand
became very unsteady, the lips compressed, the region about the
eyes showed unusual constraint, and the hand not being used was
tightly clinched. Ten trials were usually sufficient to produce
twitchings or <i>tics</i> in the face and body, although nothing of this was
ever noticed at other times. This boy invariably made hard work
of the task, and all the physical accompaniments indicated excessive
motor stimulation following, of course, upon an unduly excited
condition of the cerebral cells. At the close of the experiments
he generally seemed exhausted, and upon three occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
it was thought best not to permit him to make the entire fifteen
trials.</p>

<p>Another pupil, W. R., two years younger, illustrates a different
type. In the morning trials he was no better than A. M., but he,
too, was subjected to five different tests at half past eleven, with the
result that he could in every instance complete the task without any
apparent fatigue. There was no constraint apparent in the face or
hands, no unusual effort to co-ordinate the muscles of the body, and
no twitchings of any kind. Now, it seems probable that in the case
of W. R. the brain was able to adjust effort in right degree to the
needs of the occasion, while with A. M. there was such prodigality
in the expenditure of energy in various irrelevant motor tensions
and activities that it not only defeated its purpose, but it was soon
largely spent. A. M. showed this tendency to nervous extravagance
in all the work of the school. While an unusually bright boy,
he yet became fatigued in the performance of duties that W. R.
could discharge with no evidence of overstrain; indeed, the latter
boy seemed never to reach a point beyond which he could not go
with safety if he chose.</p>

<p>Further illustrations of this principle of individual differences
in the conservation of nervous energy were afforded by another simple
experiment. The apparatus employed consisted of a plate of
smoked glass set in a frame so that it could be moved horizontally.
Just touching the glass, and adjusted to it by a delicate spring, was
a fine metal point which could be maintained at any height by a silk
thread to be held in the fingers of the subject to be experimented
upon, who stood with closed eyes endeavoring to keep his hand perfectly
quiet for one half minute. During the test the glass was
moved slowly in the frame, the metal point thus tracing a line which
was a faithful index to most of the movements, at any rate, of the
subject's hand. Five sets of experiments were made upon a number
of pupils in the morning soon after the opening of school, and again
just before the noon recess. The accompanying tracings are reproductions
of those gained at one of the tests, and are typical examples.
The first two were secured from a girl, M. L. R., eleven
years of age. The one made at half past eleven, after two and a
quarter hours' work in school, shows a significant phenomenon which
could be easily witnessed during the experiment. She had become
so fatigued that all muscular expressions were unusually constrained.
During the short period while the experiment continued
one could observe the arm and fingers contracting, which accounts
for the upward direction of the tracing. The body swayed almost
to the point of falling, the fingers of the hand not employed were
clinched, and all the expressions indicated great tension. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
second set of tracings, gained from a girl, E. H., twelve years of
age, shows evidences of marked fatigue after a few hours' work;
but the effect upon the bodily activities is quite in contrast with that
of the case just mentioned. Here there was relaxation of the muscles,
a general letting go of the whole body, revealed in the tracings
taking an abrupt downward direction. The third group of tracings
was gained from W. R., whose characteristics have already been adverted
to, and who indicated here, as in the other tests, that his morning's
duties had had no serious effect upon his nervous energies.</p>

<p>It should be said in passing that the principle of healthful mental
growth and activity seems to require that in education of any sort
cerebral cells should be freely exercised up to the point of fatigue,
but never beyond; for after this there is not only no progress, but
what has been gained by previous training may even be lost. And,
what is more serious, the undue depletion of the nerve cell renders
its recovery extremely slow, and investigation has shown that school
children when overtaxed return to their studies day after day in a
fatigued condition, their energies not being fully restored until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
long vacation brings the needed rest.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Those who train athletes
realize that the fatigue limit must not be passed if possible, and
this law is recognized as well in the training of racing horses,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> One
who has observed his experience in learning to ride the bicycle must
have discovered that practice pursued when in a condition of exhaustion
operates rather to retard than to promote facility. So in
matters of the mind activity carried to excess, which point is further
removed in some cases than in others, results in retardation of
growth, even though no more serious consequences ensue.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>As might be readily inferred, even if we were lacking experimental
evidence, fatigue interferes with the normal activities alike of
body and mind. One of the earliest and most conspicuous effects
may be observed by any one in the people about him&mdash;a decrease in
the rapidity of physical action. The child depleted of nervous energy,
for whatever reason, will usually be slower than his fellows
in performing the various activities of home or school. If observed
during gymnastic exercises it may be noticed that his execution of
the various commands is delayed; in responding to signals he is behind
his comrades whose nervous capital is not so largely spent.
And what is here said of the child is, of course, equally true in principle
of the adult; the effect of fatigue in his case will be revealed
in less lively, vivacious, and vigorous conduct in the affairs of business
or of society. Mosso,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Burgerstein,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Scripture,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Bryan,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and
others have been able to confirm by scientific experiment what people
have thus long been conscious of in a way&mdash;that cerebral fatigue
renders one slower, more lethargic in his activities. It seems clear,
to hazard an explanation, that when nerve cells become depleted
up to the point of fatigue Nature designs that they should be released
from service in order that repair may take place. This
rhythm of action and repose seems to be common to all forms of
life. The phenomenon of sleep is an expression of this principle,
and is characterized by almost entire absence of activity.</p>

<p>Again, fatigue disturbs the power of accurate and sustained
bodily co-ordinations, particularly of the peripheral muscles, or those
engaged in the control of the more delicate movements of the body,
as of the fingers. Every one must have had the experience that consequent
upon a period of exacting labor (physical or mental), or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
worry, the hand becomes unsteady, as revealed in writing or other
fine work, the voice is not so perfectly controlled as at other times,
and perhaps involuntary twitchings or <i>tics</i> make their appearance
in the face or elsewhere. Ordinarily people regard these phenomena
as evidences simply of "nervousness," but, as commonly used,
this term does not take account of the neural conditions responsible
for these abnormal manifestations. Warner<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> points out that nerve
cells in a state of fatigue become impulsive or spasmodic in their
action; there is not such perfect balance as usually exists between
them when in a normal, rested condition, and this results in lessened
power of inhibition. Scripture<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and others have shown by experiments
in the laboratory that fatigue renders co-ordination less sustained
and accurate. If, now, one observes a group of people, young
or old, in which some or all have passed the fatigue limit, he can see
the cause of many of those occurrences which give the teacher in the
school, for example, continual trouble. The children will doubtless
be moving incessantly in their seats, books and pencils may be dropping
upon the floor, and various signals are responded to slowly and
in a disorderly manner. The restlessness is probably due for the
most part to the effort of the pupils to relieve the tension of muscles
induced by overstrain, while inability to accurately co-ordinate the
muscles employed in holding pencils and books causes objects to slip
out of the pupils' hands upon the floor. One has but to observe his
own experience, and he will soon realize that when nervously exhausted
he is not so certain of retaining securely small objects which
he handles. This accounts for what is sometimes regarded as carelessness
in school children as well as in adults, exhibited in slovenly
writing, in breaking dishes, and in similar occurrences. Any task
demanding delicate and sustained adjustment of the finer muscles
on the part of one fatigued will be liable to be performed in a careless
manner, as we are apt to feel. Often more than not the term
carelessness probably denotes impaired neural conditions, as well
as consequent mental dispersion, if one may so speak, leading to
inaccurate and intermittent mental and physical adjustments to
duties in hand.</p>

<p>Cowles<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> observes that the first prominent and serious mental
concomitant of nervous depletion is revealed in the inability to
direct the attention continuously upon any given subject; and James
has said that when one is fatigued the mind wanders in various directions,
snatching at everything which promises relief from the object
of immediate attention. Experiments in the laboratory upon the
keenness of sense discrimination of data appealing to sight, hearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
touch, and the other senses, show that there is lessened ability in
conditions of fatigue;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and this is accounted for probably by the
waning power of attention. The mind can be held to one thing,
excluding irrelevant matters. This phenomenon is further illustrated
in the following simple experiment: The pupils in a large
graded school in Buffalo, N. Y., were required upon three successive
days, at half past nine o'clock and again at half past eleven in
the morning, to trisect a line three inches long. The results, calculated
for one hundred and fifty children, show that on the average
they were several millimetres nearer correct in the morning
trisections than in those just before the midday recess.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It seems
that this test measured the degree of attention which pupils were
able to exert at different hours during the day, and it confirmed
what must in a way be known to every one&mdash;that a day's work in
school reduces the energy of attention. Doubtless every instructor
has remarked how much more difficult it is at half past eleven than
at ten to hold the thoughts of students to the subject in hand, and
if recitations in intricate studies occur late in the forenoon, progress
will be slower and more errors will be made, simply because pupils
are unable to attend so critically.</p>

<p>The significance of this latter effect of fatigue must be apparent
when it is realized that attention is at the basis of all the
intellectual processes. If one can not attend vitally, he can not
perceive readily or accurately; he will be unable to recall fully or
speedily what has formerly been thoroughly mastered; and, most
serious of all, he can not so well compare objects or ideas to discover
their relationships&mdash;that is, he is not so ready or accurate in reason.
In fatigue, then, one really becomes stupid. Suppose a fatigued
pupil in school working over his spelling lesson, for instance; he
will be liable to make errors both in copying from the board and
in reproducing what he already knows. In recitations in history,
memory will be halting; what has apparently been made secure
some time before now seems to be out of reach. In those studies
requiring reflection, as arithmetic, grammar, geography, and the
like, the reasoner will be unable to hold his thoughts continuously
to the matters under consideration, and so will be unable to
detect relationships between them readily and accurately. When
one considers, in view of what is here set forth, that many persons,
adults as well as students, are for one cause or another in a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
state of fatigue, he can see the explanation of the stupid type of individual,
in some instances at any rate.</p>

<p>The effects upon the emotional activities, while not so easily detected
by experimentation, may yet be readily observed in one's
own experiences and in the conduct of persons in his environment.

Wey,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in his studies upon the physical condition of young
criminals, has found that in the majority of instances there appears
to be some neural defect or deficiency, mostly of the nature of depletion,
which he believes contributes to alienate the moral feelings
of the individual. There is little doubt that viciousness has a physiological
basis. It is probable that in such a case the highest cerebral
regions, through which are transmitted the spiritual activities last
developed in the race, becoming incapacitated first by fatigue, are
rendered incapable of inhibiting impulses from the lower regions,
which manifest themselves in an antisocial way.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It follows from what has gone before that cerebral fatigue is
a most important matter to be reckoned with in all the affairs of
life, but especially in education, where the foundations for nervous
vigor or weakness are being permanently established, and where
relatively little can be accomplished in either intellectual or moral
training unless the physical instrument of mind be kept in good repair.
It needs no argument to beget the conviction that we should
if possible ascertain what circumstances produce fatigue most frequently
in the schoolroom, so that they may be ameliorated and
their injurious consequences thus avoided. What, then, are the
most important causes? It is well to appreciate at the outset that
every individual has a certain amount of nervous capital which,
when expended, leaves him a bankrupt, and it is of supreme import
to him that something should always be kept on the credit side
of his account. If we would deal most wisely with a pupil,
then, whose activities we are able to direct, we should know just
what demands we could make upon his energies without fatiguing
him. But we can not hope at the present time and under present
conditions to discover with accuracy the fatigue point of each individual,
and even if we were able to do so, we would doubtless find
it next to impossible to observe it at all times in our teaching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
especially in our large graded schools. But we can at any rate adjust
our requirements with some degree of accuracy to the average capacity
of the whole.</p>

<p>Regarding the number of hours of mental application per day
which may be safely expected of a pupil in school, investigations
have tended to show that there is a danger of requiring too many.
When pupils return to school morning after morning without having
recovered from the previous day's labors, it is evident that too
heavy draughts are being made upon their nervous capital. It may
be said in reply that many factors conspire to produce this depleted
condition, as insufficient sleep, inadequate nutrition, and outside
duties; but the answer is that under such unfavorable circumstances
less work may be demanded. As the curriculum is planned in many
places, alike in graded and ungraded schools, the pupil is expected
to be employed in the school for five or six hours a day no matter
what may be his age, and to this work should be added studies at home
for the older students. Now, as Kraeplin<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> has justly observed,
Nature ordains that a young child should not give six hours' daily
concentrated attention in the schoolroom, but, rather, she has taken
pains to implant deeply within him a profound instinct to preserve
his mental health by refusing to attend to hard work for such a long
period. Consequently, in such an educational <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, the mind of
the pupil continually wanders from the duties in hand. The most
serious aspect of this is apparent, that when attention is constantly
demanded and not given, or when a pupil is pretending or attempting
to keep his thoughts turned in a given direction, yet allows them
to drift aimlessly because he is practically unable to control them,
he is acquiring an unfortunate habit of mental dissipation. It
seems certain that healthful and efficient mental activity requires
that a child apply himself in a maximum degree for a relatively
short period, the duration differing with the age of the individual
and the balance of nervous energy to his credit; and then he should
relax, attention being released for a time.</p>

<p>Experiments conducted by Burgerstein<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and at Leland Stanford
Junior University<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> emphasize a particular phase of this principle&mdash;that
too long continued mental application without relaxation
induces fatigue more readily than when there are comparatively
short periods of effort, followed by intermissions of rest. Thus when
pupils (and the younger they are the more is this true) have a given
amount of work to do requiring their attention say for an hour and a
half they will accomplish most with least waste of energy by breaking
up this long stretch into several parts, interspersing a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
minutes of free play. With adults application may profitably continue
for longer periods, but even here the rhythm of concentration
and relaxation must be observed in order that effort may have the
most fruitful issue. There would assuredly be less dullness, carelessness,
and disorder in our schools, high and low, and in our homes,
if this law were observed in the arrangement of the activities of
daily life. The writer knows of a normal school where the work
begins at half past eight in the morning and continues until one
o'clock, with a pause of only ten minutes in the middle of the session.
During the passage of classes from room to room at the close
of recitations, monitors are placed in the halls to prevent any exhibition
of freedom in communicating with one another or in the
movements of the body. Here there is little if any relief to the
attention, since pupils are under practically the same constraint as
when reciting in Latin, Greek, or geometry. This enthronement
of discipline, which we all seem natively to think necessary that we
may prevent the reversionary tendencies of youth, is sure to breed
in some measure the very maladies&mdash;stupidity and disorder&mdash;which
various agencies in society are striving to cure by all sorts of formul&aelig;.</p>

<p>In the normal, well-organized adult brain the various areas are
closely knit together by association pathways or fibers,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> which renders
it possible to employ in particular direction the energies generated
over large regions. But this development comes relatively
late and is not fully completed under about thirty-three years of
age, it is now believed. It is in a measure, then, impossible for
the young child to utilize the energies produced in one part of the
brain in activities involving remote sections. One who observes
little children in their spontaneous activities can not fail to note
evidences in plenty in illustration of this principle. It should be
apparent, then, why a school programme so arranged that a lesson
in writing is followed by one in written language, this by written
number, and this in turn by written spelling, or possibly by a written
reproduction of a lesson in Nature or literature, is admirably
suited to exhaust the overused areas of pupils' brains, whereupon the
mental and physical effects of fatigue make their appearance. In
one of the large cities of our country the amount of time spent
in writing was calculated for all the grades in the schools, and it
was found that at least one hour was required of the children in
every grade, and in the fourth and fifth grades they were engaged
for two hundred minutes every day in writing in some form
or other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>
<p>Doubtless every one has observed how readily he becomes fatigued
when he is engaged in activities demanding very delicate
muscular adjustments&mdash;threading a needle, for instance. Work of
this character involves particularly the higher co-ordinating areas
of the brain, those controlling the more precise and elaborate adjustments
of the body, and this work makes large demands upon one's
nervous energy. This seems to be pre-eminently true of the child, in
whose brain the highest regions are yet comparatively undeveloped,
so that much exercise of them leads quickly to exhaustion. Those
activities, then, which compel a great amount of exact co-ordination
of young children will easily fatigue them. The writer has for some
time been observing the effect of various sorts of playthings upon
the activities, particularly upon the emotions, of two young children.
He has noticed that those plays requiring most accurate co-ordination,
as stringing kindergarten beads with small openings or writing
with a hard lead pencil, will quickly produce fatigue, shown in irritability,
discontent, and lack of control; while those plays which
employ the larger muscles, as working in sand or drawing a cart, are
more enduring in their interest and are not attended by such disagreeable
after effects. It is customary, however, in many homes
and schools to require of the youngest children the finest work in
the management of the smallest tools and materials, such, for instance,
as writing on very narrow spaced paper, greater freedom
being permitted in this respect as the pupil grows older&mdash;an inversion
of the natural order. The mode of development of the nervous
system indicates unmistakably that in all training the individual
should proceed gradually from the acquirement of <i>strength</i> and
<i>force</i> in large, coarse, and relatively inexact movements to the acquisition
of <i>skill</i> in precisely co-ordinated activities.</p>

<p>Any reference to the remediable causes of mental fatigue would
be incomplete without allusion to the harmful influence of certain
personal characteristics in the people with whom we associate. By
virtue of a great law of our being, that of suggestion, the importance
of which we are appreciating more fully from day to day, we tend
ever to reproduce within ourselves the activities of the things
in our environment.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Now, when we are forced to remain in the
presence of one fatigued, as pupils too frequently are in the school
and children in the home, and this fatigue manifests itself in irritability,
impatience, tension of voice, and constraint of face and body&mdash;in
such an environment we become overstimulated ourselves and
rapidly waste our energies. Especially true is this of children, who
are more suggestible than adults; and, in view of this, one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
appreciate the necessity of placing in our schoolrooms, and if we could
in our homes, persons possessing an endowment of nervous energy
adequate for the demands to be made upon it without inducing too
readily fatigue with all its train of evils.</p>

<h2>BEST METHODS OF TAXATION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the Late Hon. DAVID A. WELLS.</span></p>


<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p>In passing from the tariff, or duties on imports, to the internal or
excise taxes imposed by the Federal Government, there is evidently
a distinct change in purpose. However subject to abuse the
tax on distilled spirits has proved, and however frequently its agency
has been invoked to exaggerate the profits of interested parties,
there has never been an open and avowed intention of turning it to
private gain. The policy that has become almost inseparable from
the customs tariff, and is by most people regarded as inherent in all
customs legislation, has not been transferred to the internal revenue
taxes save in one or two instances of recent application and secondary
importance. The danger of permitting taxation to be employed
by either State or Federal Government for a purpose other
than that of raising necessary revenue has been dwelt upon. When
a police power is exercised in conjunction with a tax framed for
revenue, and is regarded as the more important function to be performed,
the policy requires careful examination. If revenue is the
real object, the method of imposing the tax and the determination
of the rate which will give the highest return with the least interference
in the production, distribution, and export of the commodity
taxed remains to be defined. If restriction in manufacture,
sale, or consumption is intended, the question is no longer one of
taxation proper, but of police regulation. The Federal taxes on
oleomargarine, filled cheese, and mixed flour are of the nature of
police inspection, and the tax on the circulation of State banks,
amounting, as it has, to prohibition, is a still more extreme exercise
of the same power. The imposition and collection of these duties
have a penal quality, an intention to restrict or prohibit the production
or sale or use of some article. They are not properly taxes;
they are not a proper application of tax principles, but have originated,
in private interest, or in the deliberate intention to constitute
a monopoly, State or other.</p>

<p>The approach of war, or its actual presence, is made the excuse
of an extension of taxes, and the Federal Government tacitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
admits its inability to increase indirect taxes on consumption by its
general resort to an extension of the internal taxes and excise. The
instrumentalities of business offer a fair field for stamp taxes, and
these, when not so burdensome as to invite evasion, are acceptable
because of the ease with which they are assessed and collected. A
specific duty on the more important acts of commerce and daily business
may be evaded, it is true, but not when the paper or instrument
taxed must become public evidence. Stamps of small denomination
on bonds, debentures, or certificates of stock and of indebtedness;
on a bill of sale or memorandum to sell; on bank checks, drafts, or
certificates of deposit; bills of exchange, draft, or promissory note;
money orders and bills of lading; on express and freight receipts, on
telegraph messages, and a large number of legal and other instruments,
such as leases, mortgages, charter party, insurance policies&mdash;these
are simple duties, productive of large returns, and not unequal
in their weight. The law of 1898 included such stamp taxes, as well
as others on proprietary articles and wines. It was not simple to predict
the incidence of these rates, and the distribution has been unequal.
The charges of one cent on telegraph messages and express
packages are paid by the sender in the larger number of cases, the
companies merely adding a penny to their rates. This was not the
intention of the law, and the courts have held that it was not so intended.
The individual is powerless in a few transactions, and only
the great concerns are able to avail themselves of this decision. The
duties for seats or berths in a parlor car or for proprietary medicines,
are paid by the company or manufacturer, though in certain preparations
the price to the consumer was advanced on the passage of
the act. With all their drawbacks, and they are not few in number,
these stamp duties afford a ready means of obtaining a good revenue
without increasing unduly the general burdens of taxation. The
law of 1898 was modeled after that of 1863, and many of the rates
and descriptions will undoubtedly be incorporated into the permanent
internal revenue system of the country&mdash;a measure enforced
by the remarkably unequal returns derived from the customs.</p>

<p>The existing system of internal duties is even more defensible
than the tariff as a source of revenue. Its inequalities, due to the
haste in which the measure was prepared and the inexperience of
those who framed the provisions and fixed upon the rates, are worn
away in use, and where the rates are moderate and are not infected
with a penal quality, the community adapts itself to them, accepting
them as a necessary convenience. In the United States this
spirit of acquiescence is most marked, not only because of a natural
patience of tax burdens, but because of as natural a fear of other
untried and more radical or oppressive measures. The situation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
"business" when a general tariff bill is pending in Congress is one
almost of panic, and the scramble to protect interests or to obtain
some special advantage against rivals has become a scandalous feature
of tariff revision. Except in the instances named, as oleomargarine
and filled cheese, the internal revenue system presents less
of a field for such an exhibition of greed and self-interest; but the
spirit duties, and even the tobacco rates, may be used in such a way
as to favor the large manufacturer against the small concerns, and
are to that extent misused and applied for purposes antagonistic to
those properly pertaining to taxation. In a time of tax revision the
suggestions for new taxes and ideas for changing the old are freely
offered, and do not stop short of absolute prohibition of an industry,
of total destruction of interest. The vagaries of a legislative body
under such suggestions have instilled into the public mind a wholesome
fear of its possible acts and fully explain the timid and uneasy
condition of "business" when a general tax measure is under
discussion. Whether it be the manufacturer or producer seeking
protective duties, or the Granger or Populist asking for taxes of confiscation
against capital and accumulated property, the spirit is the
same&mdash;a desire to turn taxation to improper purposes.</p>

<p>The tendency of Federal taxation to turn to taxes on capital and
the instruments of "business"&mdash;direct, rather than indirect taxes&mdash;found
its most extreme illustration in the income tax of 1894, the
principles of which have already been discussed. It finds a more
moderate and restricted exercise in certain graduated duties under
the act of 1898, and especially in the duties on legacies and distributive
shares of personal property. It was no sentimental or even
theoretical argument based upon the right of inheritance or the inequality
of taxation that led to the adoption of these duties in 1898;
it was only a blind following of the provisions of the earlier act,
and the consciousness that revenue must be had at every cost, and
no possible source of income should be overlooked. Yet the legacy
tax is essentially a tax of democracy and defensible for much the
same reasons as a tax, whether graduated or not, upon income
might be.</p>

<p>By the act approved June 13, 1898, entitled "An act to provide
ways and means to meet war expenditures, and for other purposes,"
the national Government imposed a tax upon legacies and
distributive shares of personal property. This tax has been one of
the features of the tax law of 1862 (&sect;&sect; 111-114), but in a much simpler
form and in a form better calculated to produce a revenue.
This earlier law imposed a duty on all legacies exceeding one thousand
dollars in amount, but very properly made a distinction in the
rate according to the degree of connection between the person from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
whom the property came and the receiver of the legacy. Thus,
lineal issue or lineal ancestor, brother or sister, should pay at the
rate of seventy-five cents for each and every hundred dollars of
the clear value of the interest in the property. A descendant of a
brother or sister of the decedent paid double this rate; an uncle
or an aunt was taxed three dollars for every one hundred dollars
passing; a great-uncle or a great-aunt, four dollars; and persons
in any other degree of collateral consanguinity, or a stranger, or a
body politic or corporate, five dollars. The only exemption made
was in favor of a wife or husband. As only personal property was
intended to be reached, all land and real estate escaped the duty.</p>

<p>The law of 1898 made important modifications in these rates
and manner of assessing. In the first place, the rates fell only on
legacies in excess of $10,000, a limit ten times larger than that of
the law of 1862. The degrees of relationship were the same, the
rates were copied from those of the earlier act, and the same exemption
of property passing between husband and wife was admitted.
But the idea of a progressive tax was ingrafted into the
law. Thus, the old rates applied only to legacies of more than
$10,000 and not more than $25,000. When the property passing
was valued between $25,000 and $100,000 the rates were multiplied
by one and a half; between $100,000 and $500,000, they were
multiplied by two; between $500,000 and $1,000,000, they were
multiplied by two and a half; and by three when the property was
in excess of $1,000,000. In restricting the tax to personal property
passing by inheritance the measure aims at a crude means of
making the burdens of personal more nearly approach those of real
property. No such consideration controlled the views of those responsible
for the act, and, after all, it offers only a question of theoretical
interest. The inheritance tax collected in many of the
States may have owed their adoption to such an idea, but the United
States, in taking up these duties, merely saw a means of obtaining
revenue without regarding the actual results of the tax on the
estates paying it.</p>

<p>"The inheritance tax in one form or another has come to stay,
and new States are being added every year to the list of those which
have adopted it. Five years ago it was found in only nine States
of the Union&mdash;Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New York,
West Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Tennessee, and New
Jersey. During the first half of 1893 Ohio, Maine, California, and
Michigan were added to the list, though the Michigan law was
afterward annulled because of an unusual provision in the State
Constitution which was not complied with. In 1894 Louisiana revived
her former tax on foreign heirs; Minnesota adopted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
constitutional amendment permitting a progressive inheritance tax
which has not yet been given effect by the Legislature; and Ohio
added to her collateral inheritance tax a progressive tax on direct
successions. In 1895 progressive inheritance taxes were adopted
in Illinois and Missouri, and an old proportional tax was revived
in Virginia; and last year Iowa adopted in part the inheritance tax
recommendation of her revenue commission."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The real problems are to be encountered in local taxation. The
many different methods used in the different States, the want of
uniformity in the local divisions of each State, and the extraordinary
diversity in the interpretation or application of tax laws by the courts
and executive authorities of the States have introduced a confusion,
to end which, many would invoke the intervention of the Federal
Government. The haphazard manner in which the laws have been
framed and passed is only the least notable explanation of the variety
of phrase and interpretation to be found. Even were the Federal
Government to establish definitions, and frame rules of uniform
assessment, there would still be room for difference. The customs
tariff is known to be variously applied in the different ports of the
country, and there is greater certainty in the tariff rate than could
be found in a tax resting on the assessed valuation of land, for
example.</p>

<p>The difficulty encountered by France in its attempt to determine
the net income from land for the purposes of taxation carries an
important lesson. Failing to obtain uniformity of appraisement of
this net income under the crude method first employed&mdash;of basing
it on the character of soil and nature of cultivation, deducting the
expenses of cultivation&mdash;a <i>cadastre</i> was decreed.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In this <i>cadastre</i>
each particular piece of property was recorded, with its boundaries,
its manner of cultivation, and its net rental. Begun in 1807, it was
not completed until 1850, and proved of little value, as no provision
had been made for recording the changes in cultivation, rentals, or
other conditions, except those of ownership, buildings, and exemption
from taxes. Instead of proving a successful means to a desired
end, it "turned out to be a stupendous disillusionment." "The experience
of both the western Prussian provinces and of France
showed that the newly constructed <i>cadastre</i> was of considerable service
in equalizing the land tax within a relatively small area, but not
as a basis for alterations in the contingents to be paid by large and
widely separated regions. The officials in charge of the <i>cadastre</i> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
the Rhine, as well as those in France, themselves admitted that any
computation of net income was uncertain; that the coincidence of
the figures obtained by the cadastral computation with the actual
net income could never be assured; that the figures afforded by the
<i>cadastre</i> were rather of the nature of a proportion, while uniformity
of assessment was to be attained rather by observation of the business
transacted than by depending on the figures obtained by computation."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
This effort to discover and record the net income from
land was a failure.</p>

<p>So thorough an experiment, carried through so long a time, and
presenting an example to be avoided, was in fact imitated by Prussia
under a law of 1865. In each division (<i>Kreis</i>) was appointed a
commissioner, who was chairman of a committee, the size of which
ranged from four to ten members, according to the size of the division.
One half of this committee was appointed by the representatives
of the division and one half by the central Government. A
number of divisions formed a department, with its commissioner
and committee of similar composition as in the division, and above
all was a central committee, presided over by the Minister of Finance.
The valuation was accomplished in less than four years.
The method was applied only to land employed in agriculture or
forests; a separate law provided for the taxation of buildings and
gardens. In the end the results were no better than those obtained
in France. In either case a plan too refined to work to advantage
had been employed, and, apart from its simplest function, that of
making a general survey of the land and the uses to which it was
applied, it could not advance the theory of a proper land tax. No
modification could make it a better instrument of taxation. The
gross income from land as a taxing basis would involve heavy injustice,
and further supervision by government officers could not do
away with the mechanical difficulties of securing uniformity. The
English plan of making rental value the foundation is more easily
applied and gives better results.</p>

<p>If land be difficult of assessment, personal property offers a very
much more difficult problem. On this particular question this country
has much to learn from the experience of other governments.
In Great Britain a Royal Commission has been making a study of
local taxation, and, in a preliminary report, concludes that an alteration
in the law for the purpose of obtaining a uniform basis of valuation
in England and Wales is a necessary preliminary to any revision
of the existing system of local taxation. It has been already
stated that the poor rate constituted the basis of valuation of property
for local rates. In its development the system has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
more complicated. Two valuations of the same property may be
made for raising imperial taxes&mdash;namely, one for the income tax,
and one for the land tax. Three valuations of the same property
may be made for raising local rates&mdash;namely, one for the poor rate,
one for the county rate, and one for the borough rate. Here, then,
are five different valuations in activity.</p>

<p>Of these the parish was the first and most important division,
having been introduced in the sixteenth century, when the dissolution
of the monasteries had raised the question of poor relief.
It was adopted for convenience, as the contributions were at first
entirely voluntary; but as the problem of the poor increased in
importance, compulsion was applied, and at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, by the acts of Elizabeth of 1597 and 1601, compulsion
was fully established and the parish adopted as the area for
levying rates for the relief of its poor. It now became necessary
to define more specifically the persons liable for this rate, but the
law framed no system by which assessments were to be made or
rates collected. A distinction was made between the occupier of
certain properties (such as lands, houses, coal mines, or salable
underwoods) and an inhabitant of the parish. The occupier was to
be taxed upon the basis of the annual benefit arising from the property
situated in the parish; but the inhabitant was taxed not in respect
to any specified subjects, implying an intention to tax them
upon some other basis. This raised the question of "ability," and
how that question was to be determined. The act said nothing that
could point to personal property, "and it was only on the ground
of his being an inhabitant that any owner of personal property could
be rated for that property, because there was no word in that statute
to include him, except the word inhabitant. Under that statute,
therefore, there was necessarily a distinction between residents and
nonresidents, because the resident would be ratable for his personalty
within the place, the nonresident not. The distinction, however,
under that statute applied only to those kinds of property
which the statute did not specify, for the occupier of lands, houses,
etc., and whatever the statute enumerated, was ratable whether he
were resident or not."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And when the judge of assize was asked
to give an opinion he decided that lands should be taxed equally and
indifferently, but an additional tax could be laid on the "personal
visible ability" of the parishioner. Further, "all things which are
real, and a yearly revenue must be taxed to the poor." Yet there
were limitations on this apparently wide interpretation, and as early
as 1633 it was only visible properties, both real and personal, of the
inhabitants within the parish, and only within the parish, that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
be taxed. The property to be assessed must be local, visible, and
productive; it must consist only of the surplus left after deducting
debts; it must be rated according to the profit produced; and its
nature must be distinctly specified. "Consequently, such subjects
as wages, pensions, easements, profits derived from labor and talent,
profits from money invested or lent elsewhere, and furniture, were
exempt."</p>

<p>The absence of all attempts to tax or value property other than
what was visible and tangible continued to the reign of Queen
Anne, when a single decision of the court pointed to the taxation
of the stock in trade of a tradesman, a decision that does not appear
to have been acted upon. As late as 1775 Lord Mansfield said, "In
general, I believe neither here nor in any other part of the kingdom
is personal property taxed to the poor." At all events, it could
not be taxed unless usage could support it. Toward the end of the
century, when taxation for the Napoleonic wars was touching more
intimately the concerns of the people, the idea of subjecting personal
property to the poor rate was favored, but nearly half a century
passed before it attracted attention. In their report for 1843 on
local taxation the poor-law commissioners gave the following summary
of the status of this question:</p>

<p>"The practice of rating stock in trade never prevailed in the
greater part of England and Wales. It was, with comparatively
few exceptions, confined to the old clothing districts of the south
and west of England. It gained ground just as the stock of the
wool staplers and clothiers increased, so as to make it an object with
the farmers and other rate payers, who still constituted a majority
in their parishes, to bring so considerable a property within the
rate. They succeeded by degrees, and there followed upon their
success a more improvident practice in giving relief than had ever
prevailed before in England.... When the practice of rating
stock in trade was fully established in this district, the ancient staple
trade rapidly declined there and withdrew itself still more rapidly
into the northern clothing districts, where no such burden was ever
cast upon the trade."</p>

<p>A final determination of the question was imposed upon Parliament
by the pressure of the manufacturing and commercial classes
arising from a decision in the case of R. <i>vs.</i> Lumsdaine, in 1839,
looking to the taxation of personal property. In consequence, an
act was passed (3 and 4 Vict., c. 89), and has remained in force until
the present time, exempting an inhabitant from any tax "in respect
of his ability derived from the profits of stock in trade or any other
property, for or toward the relief of the poor." Thus it is that the
English local taxation has managed to keep clear from the bog of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
assessing personal property, and the annual value of immovable
property, such as lands and houses, within the parish has come to be
selected as the simplest and most practicable basis for assessments.
The history is of high importance, because the basis of the poor rate
was adopted as the basis for all other rates levied in local taxation.
Whatever confusion has been introduced has arisen from other
causes, such as the constituting poor-law unions containing more
than one parish, the levying of county rates, a county having a
boundary other than a parish or a union, and the assessing for rates
by parish officers who acted independently of each other. Many
efforts have been made to introduce a uniform system of assessment,
but without success. One of the clearest thinkers on this subject
was Sir George Cornewall Lewis. In appearing before a committee
on taxation, in 1850, he said: "We have never recognized the principle
of having one valuation for all the different rates. If that
principle were once admitted, the inducement to have an accurate
and complete valuation would be at its maximum, because then you
would know that whatever charge might be imposed it would be imposed
upon that valuation, whereas if there is one assessment for
one rate and another assessment for another rate, and an amended
assessment for a third rate, no one cares much about making any
assessment perfect. This is one defect of the present system of
valuation."</p>

<p>The defect has persisted and become more aggravated each year.
In 1870 a special commission came to the resolution that "the great
variety of rates levied by different authorities, even in the same
area, on different assessments, with different deductions and by different
collectors, has produced great confusion and expense; and
that in any change of the law as regards local taxation, uniformity
and simplicity of assessment and collection, as well as of economy of
management, ought to be secured as far as possible." When it is
considered that for the five independent valuations for raising rates
on property there are in England and Wales more than one thousand
valuation authorities, the hopelessness of obtaining uniformity is
apparent. With such a multiplicity of agents it is useless to look
for good results. There is no fixed or necessary time for making
the valuation lists; no uniform system of or scale for making deductions
for arriving at the ratable values of certain classes of property;
exemptions and allowances are said to be given unduly, through
undue pressure on the assessing authorities; and the assessment committees
have no statutory power to ascertain from owners or occupiers
the rentals and other particulars needed to determine values.
The reforms needed are a geographical redistribution of taxing limits
and uniform rules of assessments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span></p>

<p>If so great confusion can occur where the property to be valued
for taxation is visible and tangible property, and where the principles
underlying the assessment are few and comparatively simple,
what is to be expected when the attempt to reach invisible and intangible
property is added?</p>

<p>Constitutional provisions have not secured equality of valuation,
and the statute laws are powerless to make effective the sounding
phrases of the Constitutions. "Property shall be assessed for taxes,"
says the Constitution of New Jersey, "under general laws and by
uniform rules, according to true value." The Assembly sought to
embody this principle or rule in the laws of the State. "All real and
personal estate within this State, whether owned by individuals or
corporations, shall be liable to taxation at the full and actual value
thereof, on the day in each year when by law the assessment is to
commence."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Such assertions of the basis of taxation need no
further explanation, for the intention of the framers of constitution
and law is unmistakable&mdash;equal and uniform taxation, a common
burden involving a common obligation to discharge it. The
practice at once creates the necessity for recognizing the inaptitude
of the instruments called upon to carry the law into execution.
More than four hundred separate assessors and boards of assessors
determine the taxable values upon no uniform system and in defiance
of law and Constitution. "In practice they value real estate
all the way from twenty-five to seventy-five per cent of its true
value, depending on its location, income, etc., and their personal
or political prejudices, and value different contiguous areas at different
valuations, though of equal values really; and as to personal
property, I regret to say, they appear to make no earnest or honest
effort to reach it anywhere, except in the agricultural districts, and
even there very imperfectly."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Enough has been said in these articles to show that this defect
of method is not peculiar to one State, but is to be found in all.
The remedies proposed or adopted have proved ineffectual to produce
a better result. It is asserted that the more careful selection
of the assessors, a higher salary for service, and a more strict accountability
for their acts would introduce a reform; but this could,
even under the most favorable of conditions, be only a partial reform.
A State assessor with power to remove the assessors has
been recommended, but this officer could not become so conversant
with conditions throughout the State as to be able to decide on
the many questions of assessments coming before him. Certain
descriptions of property could be dealt with by such an officer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
with an approach to fair and equal treatment. The valuation
of the "main stem" of the New Jersey roads was made by civil
engineers, and it is believed to have met the constitutional provision
as to "true value." In the valuation of a vast quantity of other
property no such expert knowledge could be applied, and especially
is this true as to "personal property." Real estate might be approximately
valued and a <i>cadastre</i> or record prepared, but after
twelve months the most carefully compiled valuation would be out
of date. Before personal property the assessor would still stand
powerless. No multiplication of officers or no system of control
over the many local assessors can solve this question in a manner
satisfactory to justice to both State and taxpayer.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, as if an abandonment of what has been
regarded as almost essential features of the State tax systems alone
offers relief. No such abandonment can be effected unless an adequate
revenue from other sources be provided. The "general property
tax," with its futile and laughable incompetency to reach the
most profitable sources of revenue, should be modified, and even
eliminated as far as is possible. The general principle underlying
it, of taxing every form of property, was suited only to a time when
the bulk of a man's estate consisted in visible and tangible objects&mdash;lands,
houses, live stock, and furniture. With every creation of a
credit instrument, with the immense development of corporations,
the principle has become weaker, until it now stands confessedly inapplicable
to at least four fifths of the personal property in existence,
and this proportion grows larger each year.</p>

<h2>PHASES OF PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By HARRIET A. TOWNSEND.</span></p>


<p>The annual reports of the "Conference of Charities and Corrections"
indicate a growing interest in the study of scientific
philanthropy. That there has been marvelous progress in
methods of charitable work during the past decade no one will deny,
but, gratifying as this is (or appears to be on the surface), we find
a somewhat discouraging feature in the tendency of the present to
multiply institutions, to inaugurate new and extravagant enterprises
where theories may be proved, and which threaten to become
burdensome to a generous public and to absorb energy in the
financial struggle to maintain them which is sorely needed for the
more vital issues of the work. The purpose of this article is to
give information about simple and practical efforts which have met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
the test of usefulness and are worthy of imitation. They are being
used in four different lines&mdash;namely, protection, education, domestic
training, and employment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Protection.</span>&mdash;The first protective agency was organized in New
York city in 1864; it is truly an American idea, and before that
date no organization of its kind had been known in England or on
the European continent.</p>

<p>As a result of the civil war many women were thrown upon
their own resources, with children to support, and much suffering
was endured in the effort to obtain adequate compensation for labor
performed. The objects of the parent protective association&mdash;"to
secure justice for women and children, to give legal advice free of
charge, and to extend moral support to the wronged and helpless"&mdash;appealed
forcibly to practical philanthropists, and there now exist
similar agencies in many other large cities in America, such as
Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Buffalo, and San Francisco. The
women's educational and industrial unions, which work "to increase
fellowship among women in order to promote the best practical
methods for securing their educational, industrial, and social
advancement," have all adopted the protective work as an important
branch of their endeavor. To give detailed statistics of all that
has been accomplished in this line since 1864 would be impossible;
indeed, so much of the work is of a private nature which can never
be revealed that one must "read between the lines" of the annual
reports; suffice it to say that by the protective department of one
women's union during a period of fourteen years more than twelve
thousand dollars unjustly withheld from working women (mostly
in small sums) has been collected, police matrons appointed
in three local stations, women given places on public boards, a
law passed compelling the appointment of women physicians in all
the State insane hospitals, and a law making the guardianship of
the mother equal to that of the father (passed by the State Legislature
without a single negative vote). All this has been done with
little expenditure of money, but through the wise effort of courageous
men and women whose service has been rendered not for
charity alone, but in the cause of justice, "that each should have
what he has justly earned is the first necessity of social life."</p>

<p>One province of the protective work is to endeavor to make
more clear the obligation of the employer and employee, and especially
in the domain of household service to place the relation on
a commercial basis. The problem of unskilled labor in the home
is the principal difficulty in the way of such reform, and until the
household economic and kindred associations shall bear more fruit
it may prove an insurmountable barrier to complete success. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
the last ten years the attention of the humanitarian has been
frequently called to the injustice of our laws regulating the "age
of consent." In some States the age has been raised to sixteen or
eighteen years and penalties increased, but through widespread
ignorance of the law it is often a dead letter in both small towns
and large cities. A law so constantly broken and with impunity
provides little protection for the young of both sexes, in whose interest
it is framed, and it is a <i>dead</i> letter because of the indifference
of the public. To spread abroad a knowledge of and help to enforce
these laws, which so intimately affect the purity of the home,
is worthy the consecrated effort of the noblest and most cultivated
women in our land. For this and other like ends the number of
protective agencies should be largely increased. In every town, or
at least in every county, such an association might be formed.
There are only required a few women with brave hearts and clear
heads, willing to give one afternoon or evening a week, the free
services of one or more able lawyers (which will never be found
lacking), a small room for a meeting place, and the work can begin.
Let notice be given through the press or in the churches that a protective
agency is formed and stands ready to offer sympathy and
advice to all women in need. Methods of work are very simple:
printed blanks are important to properly record the cases, and letterheads
which shall give names of committee and those of the attorneys;
when a claim for wages is presented, a courteous letter stating
the fact that the wage-earner has asked the assistance of the
protective agency, and requesting the defendant to answer personally
or by letter and to state his side of the case, will generally receive
response; great care must be observed to be just to both parties,
and not to make hasty nor unwarrantable decisions.</p>

<p>The laws affecting the rights and property of women of New
York have been briefly compiled for the use of protective associations,
and it is very easy to obtain in any State a copy of the laws
regulating domestic service for reference in making decisions. The
Legal Status of Women, compiled by Jessie J. Cassidy (a graduate
of Cornell), will be found useful. If in the beginning the work
of protection should be misunderstood and resented it matters
not; in time it will win the respect and co-operation of the best
elements in any community. What a moral force would an "endless
chain" of such workers prove in the struggle for universal
brotherhood! To give courage to the most humble beginning we
have the word of our philosopher that "every reform was once a
private opinion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domestic Training.</span>&mdash;Scientific domestic training or household
science is becoming a subject of great interest to all who believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
that a truer development of home life lies at the foundation of all
social and moral progress.</p>

<p>Three large institutions&mdash;Pratt, of Brooklyn; Drexel, of Philadelphia;
and the College of Teachers, in New York city&mdash;present
opportunities for the thorough training of teachers in this comparatively
new branch of popular education.</p>

<p>Clubs for the study of household economics are multiplying year
by year; the Association of Collegiate Alumn&aelig; has given earnest
thought to the domestic problem, and as a result, and in spite of
much prejudice, courses of cookery have been made a part of the
public-school curriculum in a few of our large cities. The Board
of Regents of New York State has recently adopted a syllabus for
a course in home science to be used in the high schools. While the
movement, as yet, may be said to be in the experimental stage, it
is safe to assert that sentiment in favor of the new idea is increasing.
The difficulties in the way of a rapid growth are formidable
and make the outlook somewhat discouraging.</p>

<p>To properly equip a school for scientific domestic training is
in the beginning a considerable expense; the number of skilled
teachers ready for the field is small, and their services too valuable
to be given without adequate compensation. The cooking schools
so far established have not proved self-sustaining, and until more
sensible ideas as to the dignity of household labor shall prevail, limitations
will continue.</p>

<p>In all reforms we must "dig at the roots" if we would insure
a steady and healthful growth. The kitchen-garden idea, originated
by Miss Emily Huntington in 1887 for "the purpose of giving
the little daughters of the poor attractive instruction in housework,"
has proved one of the best means of practical philanthropy
ever discovered. The New York Kitchen-Garden Association was
formed in 1880, and from that, as its crowning work, we have the
New York Training School for Teachers. The kitchen-garden lessons
are very simple; they include how to make beds and take care
of sleeping rooms, set and wait on table, wash and iron clothes, care
of a baby and the nursery, how to build fires, clean lamps, sweep
and dust, instruction in house-cleaning, marketing, and the care of
the person&mdash;all taught by miniature utensils to the accompaniment
of songs and exercises, which give enthusiasm and variety to the
work. The training of the kitchen-garden teacher is not difficult,
and young women in any community, by a few lessons as to the methods
and a study of kitchen-garden literature, may soon become
efficient.</p>

<p>Children of the ages of from five to eleven are eligible for the
training, and both girls and boys enjoy the classes. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
various lessons have been mastered, the next step for girls is into the
cooking class, and if on account of the expense or for any other reason
the scientific teacher is <i>not</i> available, the courses may be given
by housekeepers. Very practical results were thus obtained by
one organization of women. A class of fourteen young girls graduated
from a kitchen garden were given instruction for twenty
weeks on every Saturday morning; the lessons were divided into four
short courses; five each were given in the preparation of breakfast,
luncheon, dinner, and supper. Every fifth morning was devoted
to a practice lesson, when the little cooks prepared and served a
meal without assistance.</p>

<p>While the number of kitchen gardens is increasing there are
yet many localities where the good seed has not taken root; no
better work in village or town could enlist the faithful service of
King's Daughters or of societies for Christian Endeavor. An inexpensive
outfit of kitchen-garden utensils can easily be procured and
the work begun. When a class is ready to graduate from the kitchen
garden the voluntary service of half a dozen notable housekeepers,
who will give the simple lessons in cooking once a week, will yield
a most satisfactory harvest. The unconscious tuition of the cultivated
house mother is often of greater value than all else. A little
girl of eleven years given such opportunities enthusiastically exclaimed,
"I've taught my mother how to make bread!" The
mother, a peasant woman from across the sea, had passed her childhood
and youth in the fields, and, like many of her class, had received
no training for the responsibilities of motherhood. To the
large number of foreigners, who are constantly seeking homes in
our free land, the privileges of the kitchen garden and the free cooking
school would prove an inestimable blessing. When housework
shall take its proper place among the professions, the chaos which
now abounds in a majority of American homes will be forever banished.
In home making, regarded as one of the noblest objects of
every woman's life&mdash;in fact, <i>the</i> object whenever possible&mdash;lies the
hope of the future. To this end God speed the kitchen garden and
the cooking school!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education.</span>&mdash;The public school and kindergarten, free libraries,
art galleries and museums, cheap literature, and compulsory education
laws would seem, to the casual observer, to leave little need for
the philanthropist in the field of education. A philosopher of to-day
looks forward to the time when "the object of all free education
shall be the emancipation of the individual," and to the time
"when general education shall be supplemented by special schools
for the special vocations of life."</p>

<p>The trend of the present system of education may be in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
direction and the prospect more or less hopeful, but that the schools
and other opportunities mentioned do not now reach all who need
instruction is demonstrated by the success of the various clubs,
classes, and lectures which form so important a part of the humanitarian
associations of to-day. Everywhere are found men and
women of middle age who can not read or write, who were denied
even a common-school education in youth; to reach such as these
and make them not ashamed to accept and make use of the privileges
for which they have secretly longed is practical philanthropy.
Among the foreign-born population many children are early forced
to help earn the necessities of life, and are taken from school as
soon as the law will allow.</p>

<p>The college settlements have already accomplished much for
this class, but their work has been confined to thickly settled districts
in large communities. The story of The Abandoned Farm
in New England is familiar, and bears its own pertinent lesson. Because
of the opportunities for education, entertainment, and varied
employment which the large city offers, the young people desert the
farm, home ties are broken, and many lives ruined. Of the low
ideals which prevail in many country districts there are striking
illustrations.</p>

<p>A bright woman sojourning for a winter in a small town found
that there were two hotels or taverns where liquor was sold, two
churches where only occasional services were held, a single school-house
kept open during the winter months, no hall except the ballrooms
of the hotels (used only for dancing), no library, and no entertainments
of a literary order. This woman organized a club or
debating society, and after a few months of careful guidance she
allowed the members to select their own topic for the last meeting
of the season; to her great surprise, a debate was announced on
the subject, "Whether it is better for a young man upon coming
of age to have one thousand dollars or a good education." The
majority decided that it would be better to have the money, because
he could then speculate and gain a fortune!</p>

<p>What better missionary work could be done in behalf of education
than to establish a "thought center" in every farming region
or small town? The system of traveling libraries, a recent
and encouraging movement, makes it possible (in some States) to
place the best books and current literature in the homes of the
farmers and of the inhabitants of the smallest towns. The books
can be obtained, made use of, and exchanged for others, so that the
interest may be perpetuated; the conditions are not difficult, and
the fact that a room or rooms must be provided for the safe keeping
and the circulation of the library is important. A traveling library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
once secured, a "thought center" is established. Lectures, clubs,
and classes will follow; they are a natural sequence. In addition
to literary topics, talks on personal purity, physical culture (respect
for the body as the temple of the soul), and on home ideals
(plain living and high thinking) may be given. Good men and
women, fitted to speak well on these subjects, will be ready to give
their services. Where enthusiasm is once aroused, seed can be
sown by such nonsectarian gatherings which fails to take root in
the churches.</p>

<p>We are taught that the highest authority within man is the
conscience. Rosenkranz, in his Philosophy of Education, gives this
fine definition of conscience: "Conscience is the criticism which
the ideal self makes on the realized self." To discover and quicken
the ideal self wherever possible is one of the noblest aims of practical
philanthropy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Employment.</span>&mdash;A recent report of the United States Labor Commissioner,
Hon. Carroll D. Wright, states that the number of women
laborers is increasing, but that women are more generally taking
the places of children than of men; that the encroachment of women
upon the occupations held by men is so far very slight, and only in
conditions where women are better adapted for the particular work
in which they are employed.</p>

<p>"Women," he says, "are considered by many employers to be
more reliable, more easily controlled, neater, more rapid, industrious,
polite and careful, and less liable to strike than men. Wyoming
and Utah are cited as the only States which have laws according
to men and women equal wages for equal work. There
is still much economic injustice as to compensation for women's
work, although some progress has been made within the last
few years."</p>

<p>The agitation of the question of "equal pay for equal work,"
if it has not as yet accomplished much for the woman wage-earner,
has at least revealed the fact that women as a class are not as well
trained for the work they attempt as men. The number of unskilled
women in all branches of trade presents a problem which
may well engage the attention of the philanthropist. The necessity
of earning to "keep the wolf from the door," the pleasure resulting
from financial independence, and a desire to add to "pin
money" have all tended to increase the number of girls and women
who are seeking employment outside the home. The fever has extended
to the smaller towns, and even to the farmers' wives and
daughters, until the supply greatly exceeds the demand in many
localities, and the women really in need are often crowded to the
wall in this inadequate race. In the passing of old ideas as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
proper status of woman much good has been evolved; it is no longer
considered degrading to earn one's living, and the woman worker
in every field is winning her way to the respect and recognition
which she deserves.</p>

<p>What can be done to raise the standard of woman's work, to
give more thorough training in vocations for which women are best
fitted, to dignify important occupations which suffer from the lack
of skilled service and which are not overcrowded because of mistaken
ideas, and, above all, to make women ashamed to receive compensation
which they do not fully earn?</p>

<p>The employment bureaus connected with the various organizations
of women are endeavoring to answer these questions. Their
object, as outlined, is to advise and adopt such methods as shall best
assist women in their chosen vocations; to also provide a bureau of
registration where applications can be received and information
given.</p>

<p>A committee of practical women supervises the work and endeavors
not only to secure temporary positions, but to confer permanent
benefits on those who seek their aid. The applicants usually
include stenographers, typewriters, copyists, clerks, governesses,
matrons, nurses, housekeepers, seamstresses, laundresses, cooks, and
housemaids. It is the rule, and not the exception, to find a girl
or woman <i>specially</i> fitted for the position she seeks. The majority
are not fitted even to do <i>one</i> thing well, and the ignorance and assumption
shown are appalling.</p>

<p>To discover latent ability, to stimulate the desire to excel, to
explain the rights of the employer and employee, and the moral
obligations of both, is a part of the privilege of the women who give
time and thought to the employment problem.</p>

<p>The Boston Women's Educational and Industrial Union has
been able to render excellent service by the distribution of circulars
cautioning women against advertisements which offer large returns
for work done at home. Its list of fraudulent firms, obtained
by thorough investigation, has been sent to other associations, and
has already proved of inestimable value to many women who would
otherwise have been tempted to send money, allured by the attractive
advertisements.</p>

<p>The list compiled gives the names of one hundred firms which
are a "delusion and a snare," and which, on account of some trifling
technicality, the law seems unable to touch.</p>

<p>To exalt the home and raise the standard of domestic service
is another important object&mdash;perhaps the most important of all.
From the ordinary intelligence office to the employment bureau
under the guidance of educated women is a long step for progress.</p>

<p>In all humane effort, the more scientific the methods employed
the better will be the results. According to Charles
Kingsley, "scientific method needs no definition&mdash;it is simply
the exercise of common sense."</p>

<h2>HERBERT SPENCER AT SEVENTY-NINE.</h2>


<p>The portrait of Herbert Spencer, which forms the frontispiece
to this number of the Monthly, is from a photograph taken
soon after he reached the age of seventy-eight. Though of late
years his health has been unusually feeble, this is scarcely reflected
in the face, which still retains in a marked degree the expression
of intellectual strength that was so characteristic of his prime.</p>

<p>About the time Mr. Spencer completed the Synthetic Philosophy,
or, as it is better known, the Philosophy of Evolution, with the
publication of the third volume of the Principles of Sociology, we
gave an account of The Man and his Work, from the pen of Prof.
William H. Hudson, who had for a number of years acted as his secretary,
and was so familiar with his thought that he afterward published
an Introduction to the Philosophy, which Mr. Spencer himself
has cordially commended. It was naturally supposed by his
many friends that having practically carried out his original plan as
laid down in his prospectus thirty-six years before, Mr. Spencer
would throw off the cares and vexations of authorship, to enjoy the
rest and relaxation that his arduous and long-continued labors had
earned. But this, it seems, he was not inclined to do. Apparently
as active intellectually as ever, he has kept at work to the full extent
of his physical ability, devoting himself mainly to such additions
and modifications of his published writings as new knowledge
and the advance of thought have made necessary. This persistent
industry, unusual, to say the least, in one so far advanced in life,
the presentation of his latest portrait, and the interest which the
world takes in the doings of a man who has so profoundly influenced
the thought of his time, make this a fitting opportunity to refer to
some of the later incidents in his career.</p>

<p>Though never inclined to plume himself on the importance or
the grandeur of his great undertaking, wondering now that he ever
had the "audacity" to begin it, and regarding its completion as more
an "emancipation" than a triumph, Mr. Spencer is nevertheless
entitled to the satisfaction which comes from the contemplation
in the evening of a long life of the fulfillment of the purpose to
which that life has been devoted. Although he speaks of the series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
of works comprising the Synthetic Philosophy as "complete yet incomplete,"
because more things might have been put into it, Mr.
Spencer has the unquestionable right to look upon his "system"
as finished in all the essentials of a symmetrical and self-sustaining
structure; and more than this, he finds it generally accepted as a
masterpiece, embodying, if not all the truth, yet a fundamental
truth manifested in the growth and order of the universe of matter
and mind.</p>

<p>When we regard the comprehensiveness of Mr. Spencer's system,
embracing everything there is, and the multitude of the details that
had to be considered in the course of its preparation, we wonder at the
magnitude of the aggregation that may be formed by the repetition
of small daily tasks. The portions of time he was able to give to
work were at most very brief, and would be regarded by the majority
of workers as insufficient for any great accomplishment; and
when the frequent and sometimes long interruptions that occurred
are considered, seem absolutely insignificant. Yet in these small
fragments of two or three hours a day with many lost days in the
year, and several lost years, one of the greatest works in the history
of the human mind was carried to its end. The old figure of
the dropping of the water on the stone and the fable of the tortoise
and the hare are newly illustrated.</p>

<p>Outside of his work in the composition of the Philosophy, Mr.
Spencer has always taken a vital interest in leading public questions,
making them the subjects of frequent communications to the press,
and seeking the co-operation of others when opportunity offered either
in combating some needless innovation or aiding some important
reform. True to the teaching of his philosophy, it will be observed
that in any attempts of the kind his reliance has always been on
the power of gradual development, rather than abrupt changes by
acts of Parliament or otherwise, to bring about desired conditions.
Before his visit to the United States, in 1882, he interested himself
in forming an Anti-Aggression League, for the purpose of opposing
schemes for extending the lines of British dominion in various parts
of the world. Among his associates in this effort were Mr. John Morley,
Mr. Frederic Harrison, and the Rev. Llewellyn Davis and Canon
Fremantle, now Dean of Ripon, liberal-minded clergymen of the
Church of England. The movement found little public sympathy,
and no adequate support. Mr. Spencer, severely taxing his strength
in promoting it, suffered another breakdown (from which he has
never fully recovered), in consequence of which the next number
of his Philosophy&mdash;Part VI of the Principles of Sociology: Ecclesiastical
Institutions&mdash;did not appear till the close of 1855. It
is worthy of remark in connection with this incident that it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
to have been left for non-Christians almost alone in a professedly
Christian community to take the advance in inculcating and disseminating
one of the central ideas of the Christian religion; as
now, in the United States, with the orthodox church people almost
unanimous in supporting war and the wildest schemes of aggression,
it has been left for a few New England Unitarians first to dare to
speak in protest against an iniquitous and perilous crusade for foreign
dominion. Mr. Spencer has never neglected an opportunity to express
in unmistakable terms his aversion to militancy, and has been at
great pains to demonstrate, as in his Sociology, that the true road to all
higher development of society is through encouraging the growth of
its industrial factors.</p>

<p>A disposition manifested among English legislators to favor the
passage of acts embodying some of the ideas of the socialists led to
the publication of a series of magazine articles showing the demoralizing
tendencies of measures of paternalism and foreshadowing the
disastrous ultimate results that would ensue from the unnecessary
interference of the state. These were afterward collected and published
under the title of The Man <i>versus</i> the State, and are now
bound up with the revised Social Statics.</p>

<p>From the spring of 1886 till 1889, when conditions of health
compelled entire suspension of the work on the Philosophy, and it
was even doubtful whether it could ever be continued, Mr. Spencer
dictated the larger part of his autobiography. This has since been
completed and put in print, but will not be published during his lifetime.
It will comprise two considerable volumes.</p>

<p>Not finding life in a boarding house in all respects suited to his
wishes, Mr. Spencer for many years entertained the idea of establishing
himself in a home of his own in the suburbs of London, but
had been deterred from so doing by the prospective troubles of
housekeeping. In the summer of 1889, however, after making such
arrangements as promised to relieve him in great measure of these
cares, he finally carried out the idea by taking a house in the neighborhood
of Regent's Park. But though for some years the bachelor
household was a success, we understand it eventually ceased to
be so, though it was continued until Mr. Spencer changed his residence
to Brighton two years ago. There was wanting in those who
had immediate charge of details that feeling of identity of interests
and that disposition to co-operate which belong to the ordinary family,
and as a consequence differences grew up that could not be permanently
composed, and that on the whole did not conduce to domestic
tranquillity.</p>

<p>About the time his housekeeping experience was entered upon,
Mr. Spencer found himself well enough to go on with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
composition of his Philosophy. As he relates in the preface to the
Data of Ethics and to Justice, he had already, ten years before, in
the imminent doubt of ever being able to complete the work as it
had been laid out, determined to devote his attention first to the end
and ultimate object of the system&mdash;to that part of it to which all
the rest was intended to lead up; the purpose, "lying behind all
proximate purposes," of finding a scientific basis for the principles
of right and wrong in conduct at large. When, now, the question
arose again of what work to undertake first, completion of the Principles
of Ethics was at once decided upon. As it was still doubtful
whether he would be able to accomplish even this, he took up
the part which seemed most important&mdash;Justice. This was published
as Part IV of the Ethics in the summer of 1891. No further
serious interruptions occurred in the execution of the work.
Parts II and III, completing the first volume of the Ethics, were
finished in the spring of 1892; and a year afterward Parts V and
VI were added, forming, with Justice, the second volume.</p>

<p>The ethical part of the Philosophy as contemplated by Mr. Spencer
having been completed, only two divisions remained to be worked
out&mdash;Professional Institutions and Industrial Institutions, parts of the
Principles of Sociology&mdash;to fill out the whole plan. A subsidiary
discussion of considerable importance for the integrity of the theory
of evolution now intervened to be disposed of before these parts of the
work could be proceeded with. Prof. August Weismann had published
a book in which he denied the transmission of acquired characters;
or, as Mr. Spencer would word it, the transmission of functionally-wrought
modifications&mdash;a very vital point in all Mr. Spencer's
philosophy. Mr. Spencer took the matter up at once, and published
several incisive essays refuting Professor Weismann's positions.
He opened his argument against the neo-Darwinian position
with essays on the Inadequacy of Natural Selection, and on Professor
Weismann's Theories, and followed them, at intervals of a
few months, with the additional articles, A Rejoinder to Professor
Weismann, and Weismannism Once More. Anxious that the question
should be brought to the notice of every biologist, Mr. Spencer
had reprints of these essays distributed among the teachers of the
science all over Europe and America.</p>

<p>The work on the final stage of Mr. Spencer's great undertaking
was begun about the middle of 1894. The reading of an editorial
in the Popular Science Monthly having suggested to him that it
would be desirable to do so, he published the chapters on Professional
Institutions&mdash;serially in this periodical and in the Contemporary
Review. The chapters on Industrial Institutions did not appear
till the third volume of the Sociology was issued in November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
1896&mdash;the volume which was the culmination of the work so persistently
prosecuted in the face of the most formidable and even
seemingly hopeless difficulties. In these departments of the system,
the argument was pursued, consistent with that which prevails
in all the other departments, that in the professions and the industries
the principle of evolution operates just as surely and completely
as in the derivation of an animal species from its ancestral
form.</p>

<p>Appreciation of the value of Mr. Spencer's work had been growing
for many years, and its influence was gradually making itself felt
in movements of various kinds in the active world. Whatever he
wrote or said received attention at once, was discussed, or influenced
action. The completion of his Philosophy was deemed worthy of
formal notice and a proper subject for felicitation wherever science
was known, and in England was regarded as a suitable object for a
national memorial. An address of congratulation was prepared for
presentation to him, and with it went a request that he would have his
portrait painted to be presented to the nation. It has always been his
principle to decline offers of testimonials, on the ground that the custom
had become an abuse, and persons invited to participate in presentations
were often put under a kind of moral obligation to comply, to
which he would not be, even incidentally, a party. Consistently with
this attitude and not realizing the real nature of the movement in favor
of a testimonial and how really spontaneous it was, he wrote to its
promoters repeating his objections and asking that it be not pressed.
But when the address was presented and he saw the list of illustrious
names attached to it, including those of men who had been his antagonists,
he yielded to what was evidently a spontaneous feeling of
the representative men among his countrymen, and sat for his portrait
as soon as circumstances permitted, or about a year afterward, to
Mr. Hubert Herkomer. The following is the letter of congratulation
and the request for his portrait, with the names of the distinguished
signers, and Mr. Spencer's reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Camp, Sunningdale</span>, <i>December 16, 1896</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: We, the undersigned, offer you our cordial congratulations
upon the completion of your System of Synthetic Philosophy.</p>

<p>Not all of us agreeing in equal measure with its conclusions, we
are all at one in our estimate of the great intellectual powers it exhibits
and of the immense effect it has produced in the history of thought;
nor are we less impressed by the high moral qualities which have enabled
you to concentrate those powers for so many years upon a purpose
worthy of them, and, in spite of all obstacles, to carry out so
vast a design.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>

<p>To the many who, like us, have learned to honor the man while
profiting by his writings, it would be a satisfaction to possess an authentic
personal likeness of the author. It has therefore occurred to
us that the occasion might be appropriately marked by requesting you
to permit us to employ some eminent artist to take your portrait, with
a view, to its being deposited in one of our national collections for the
benefit of ourselves and of those who come after us.</p>

<p>We hope that your health may be benefited by the leisure which
you have earned so well, and that you may long continue to enjoy the
consciousness of having completed your work.</p>

of signatures, nor do I think myself entitled to bear a prominent part
in the present case. But I beg that you will, if you think proper, set
me down as an approver of the request to Mr. Spencer, whose signal

so justly objects of admiration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Hooker</span>: If, as may fitly be said, the value of congratulations
increases in a geometrical progression with the eminence of
those offering them, I may, indeed, be extremely gratified by the
accumulation coming from men standing so high in various spheres.
And an accompanying pleasure necessarily results from the good wishes
expressed for my health and happiness during my remaining days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span></p>

<p>The further honor offered has caused in me some mental conflict.
Eight years ago, to the inquiry whether I would sit for a subscription
portrait to be painted by Millais, I replied negatively, assigning the
reasons that the raising of funds to pay the costs of conferring marks
of approbation had grown into an abuse; that the moral coercion under
which contributions were in many cases obtained was repugnant to
me; and that I objected to have my known and unknown friends asked
to tax themselves to the required extent. These reasons survived, and,
swayed by them, I recently sent a copy of the letter in which they had
been stated to the gentleman with whom the proposal now made originated,
thinking thereby to prevent further trouble. I was unaware
to how large an extent the proposal had been adopted and how distinguished
were the numerous gentlemen who had given it their support.
I now find myself obliged either inconsistently to waive my objection
or else rudely to slight the cordially-expressed feelings and wishes of
so many whose positions and achievements command my great respect.
Between the alternatives there seems to be practically no choice. I am
compelled to yield to the request made in so sympathetic a manner
by signatories so eminent, and at the same time must express to them
through you my full sense of the honor done me.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 3em;">I am, my dear Hooker, sincerely yours,</span><br />

<p>Marks of honor offered to Mr. Spencer from time to time since
1871 have included doctor's degrees from the Universities of St.
Andrews, Bologna, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Buda-Pesth; and
elections as foreign member or correspondent of the Academies of
Rome, Turin, Naples, Paris, Philadelphia, Copenhagen, Brussels,
Vienna, Milan, and the Prussian order "<i>Pour le M&eacute;rite</i>." Mr. Spencer
has been prompted year after year to decline these various honors
by the conviction that instead of being, as commonly supposed,
encouragements to literature and science, they are discouraging.
He contends that they constitute a system of inverse handicapping.
In physical competitions it is usual to give the younger a certain artificial
advantage when they are set against the elder; but in these
mental competitions between the rising men and the men who have
risen the reverse practice is followed&mdash;the men who have risen
have an artificial advantage, and the younger men, who of necessity
have much to struggle against, have their difficulties artificially
increased by the absence of titles which their competitors possess.
Mr. Spencer is quite aware that the course he has persistently followed
has cost him much, since a list of honors on the title-pages
of his books would have greatly increased the attention paid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
them by critics and others. Nevertheless, he has continued to make
this practical protest.</p>

<p>Since completing his Philosophy, Mr. Spencer has occupied his
working hours with the revision of the Principles of Biology, making
the modifications and incorporating the new facts which the progress
of the science demands. He recognizes that the advance has been
more rapid in this branch than in any other; and that while it might
be almost hopeless for him at his time of life to bring a work on
biology at large up to date, the case is different in an exposition of the
Principles of Biology. The additions to the work include a chapter
on Metabolism supplementing the discussion of vital changes of matter;
a chapter on the Dynamic Element in Life, to render less inadequate
the conception of life previously expressed; some pages on
Structure; an account, under the head of Cell Life and Cell Multiplication,
of the astonishing actions in cell nuclei which the microscope
has revealed; a further chapter on Genesis, Heredity, and
Variation, in which certain views enunciated in the first edition of
the book are qualified and developed; a review of various modern
ideas under the title of Recent Criticisms and Hypotheses; a rewriting
of most of the chapter on The Argument from Embryology;
and a number of changes incorporated as sections in pre-existing
chapters. The articles on Weissmannism are incorporated
in an appendix. In performing this work assistance was
needed, and the author sought and received criticism and help from
different persons, each taking a division falling within the range of
his special studies: Prof. W. H. Perkin in organic chemistry and
its derived subjects; Prof. A. G. Tansley in plant morphology and
physiology; Prof. E. W. MacBride and Mr. J. T. Cunningham in
animal morphology; and Mr. W. B. Hardy in animal physiology.
The first volume of this work, recently published, has been received
with favor by persons of all shades of opinion respecting the questions
it touches. The London Times, in not the friendliest of criticisms,
says that even persons who do not accept the author's Philosophy will
rejoice that he has been able to complete it, and adds that as it stands
it "is a marvel of erudition: every page exhibits the wealth and
variety of illustration for which Mr. Spencer is justly famous." The
latest notice of it that we have observed, a French one in the <i>Revue
Scientifique</i>, says that in consulting it biologists "will not lose their
time, and many will find valuable ideas in it, suggestions by which
their experimental work can not fail to be greatly benefited. And,
like us, they will be filled with admiration for a work so condensed,
and at the same time so admirably co-ordinated, so replete with facts
and ideas, of the philosopher who has exercised so great an influence
on the science of his times, and who is one of the finest intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
glories of his country and of the present epoch." Perhaps one of the
most significant of recent testimonials of appreciation of the Synthetic
Philosophy is the announcement of the publication of a complete
translation of First Principles into Japanese by Mr. Fujii, who
has devoted several years to the work. "Mr. Spencer's works," it
is added, "have long had a great attraction for Japanese translators."
Mr. Spencer is now engaged upon the second volume of the
Biology.</p>

<p>It was formerly Mr. Spencer's custom to spend about nine months
of the year in London and the three summer months in the country,
but for several years past he has found the fogs and other gloomy
winter conditions of the metropolis too trying. The confinement enforced
upon him by increasing feebleness has, moreover, precluded his
enjoyment of the social privileges, particularly of the Athen&aelig;um
Club, which were one of the attractions that made a town residence
tolerable. He therefore, at the beginning of 1898, took up his residence
in Brighton, where he has a house looking upon the sea, and
giving him the benefit of the flood of light which that place enjoys.</p>

<p>At present Mr. Spencer is able to give very little time to work,
and being confined to the house most of the time, the routine of his
daily life admits of little variety. His first business in the day is
to hear the morning paper read; then he attends to his correspondence,
and if well enough does a little work. If any matter is going
through the press he will generally be seen with a proof close by.
His afternoon is spent in such relaxation as is afforded by scanning
the illustrated papers and magazines, listening to music,
which must always be classical, or, if sufficiently well, a drive;
and he retires at ten o'clock.</p>

<h2>Editor's Table.</h2>


<h3><i>SCIENCE AND THE STATE.</i></h3>

<p>It is probably not too much to
say that the true measure of the
intelligence and efficiency of a government
is the extent to which, in
the various spheres of activity which
it controls, it recognizes the authority
and adopts the methods of science.
There is one department of
Government&mdash;the remark might be
applied to nearly all civilized governments,
and very pointedly to our
own&mdash;in which science receives a
large and serious recognition, and
that is the Navy Department. We
have lately had a striking exhibition,
which the world at large has watched
with great interest, of the high state
of efficiency to which a navy can
be brought in a comparatively short
space of time. If the question is
asked how it was done, there is but
one answer: it was done by recognizing
science and working on scientific
lines. To work on scientific lines is
simply to study carefully, in the
light of the best available knowledge,
the means for accomplishing a desired
end, and having found the best
means, to adopt them in practice.
Our naval administration has fortunately
been able to repel if not wholly,
at least to a remarkable extent,
the intrusion of "political" influence,
and has consequently been able
to apply itself without serious distraction
to the accomplishment of
its own special tasks. It has called
science to its aid not only as regards
purely physical questions, but as regards
questions of organization; and
the result is that it has succeeded in
giving the nation not only ships and
guns, but the men who are fitted by
knowledge, by training, and by discipline
to make the best possible use
of the ships and guns.</p>

<p>Next to the navy in the recognition
accorded to science, but yet a
long way off, comes the army. We are
speaking now, of course, of our own
army; and what the "long way off"
meant in waste of money and of human
life, in the suffering and misery
of brave men, is a too familiar tale.
Had science governed the operations
of the land forces and presided over
their whole organization to the same
extent that it did over the operations
and organization of the navy, a certain
recent page of history would
have borne a very different record,
and would not have been so burdened
as it is with shame and heartache
to patriotic citizens.</p>

<p>Killing and being killed are serious
matters, and everybody understands
that the business can not safely
be trifled with. That is why science
is allowed to have its own way
almost entirely in the navy, and to
exercise a large measure of control
in the army, with the effect of rendering
the first a nearly perfect machine,
and giving to the latter a high
degree of efficiency for its own purposes.
But have we not here object
lessons which ought to be applied to
other departments of the Government?
Is it only in the matter of
killing that the aid of science is required?
Can the public at large not
rise to the conception that, if science
can make splendid killing machines,
it might also, if allowed fair play,
make excellent administrative machines
for peaceful purposes? We
have departments which deal with
such important matters as currency
and finance, agriculture and statistics,
the administration of justice,
the control of railway traffic, the
erection of public buildings and the
improvement of waterways, the carrying
out of geodetic and geological
surveys, the representation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
country abroad, the protection of the
public health, and, finally, the great
question of public education. It
must be obvious to every thoughtful
person that, if science could have its
say and its way in relation to these
matters, it would put them all on the
best footing which the existing condition
of knowledge permits. It
would ask, "What are the objects to
be accomplished?" and would proceed
to select the persons and adopt
the means best fitted to realize those
objects. The country would then
have a civil service in which economy
and efficiency would be equally
conspicuous, and which would furnish
examples for imitation in private
enterprise of the best ways of
doing things.</p>

<p>It is needless to say how far removed
the present condition of government
business is from anything
like scientific organization. If killing
must be done scientifically, the
injured feelings of the politician find
relief in insisting that nearly everything
else within the sphere of government
action shall be done most
unscientifically. In the filling of important
positions the first thing considered
is not the question of fitness
for the work to be done, but the question
of party advantage. It is not
too much to say that a prejudice frequently
exists against a man conspicuously
qualified by knowledge,
experience, and character for a given
post. There is an uncomfortable
feeling that such a man might not be
sufficiently pliable afterward in the
hands of those who had appointed
him&mdash;that the preposterous idea
might get into his head that, having
obtained the office on his merits, he
was at liberty, in the execution of
his duties, to think only of the public
interest. The preference of the politician,
therefore, for "the boys" is
easily understood; but "the boys"
and science do not work hand in
hand.</p>

<p>Our universities are turning out
year by year men possessing the
highest scientific qualifications, men
who have studied both in this country
and in Europe, and who are prepared
to take any positions in which
scientific work is required. Some of
these are absorbed by the teaching
profession, but the great majority
find employment in the various industries
of the country. Unfortunately,
the attainments of such men
give them no special advantage as
regards employment in the public
service of the country; to qualify for
that they must graduate in another
school entirely, and get certificates
from a very different class of professors.
We are far from holding the
opinion that men of high education
should dissociate themselves from
the political life of the country; but
it is unhappily true that the kind of
interest which an intelligent man
who places the nation above party
can take in politics is not likely to
recommend him to those who have
the dispensing of places. The fact
should, however, be emphasized that
if science does not receive due recognition
in connection with the public
services, it is not because of any lack
of native-born citizens capable of
representing it with credit and even
with distinction. In this respect
America has placed herself fully
abreast with the most advanced nations
of the modern world, and the
Government has only to say what
service it requires in order to have
its choice of men possessing every
qualification to render that service
in the most competent and satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>In the last resort, it must be admitted,
the fault rests with the people.
It is with reluctance that the
average elector acknowledges&mdash;if he
can be brought to acknowledge at all&mdash;that
any public office requires special
qualifications. Such an idea
seems to be at war with true democratic
doctrine, and to imply a serious
abridgment of the powers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
people's representatives. It is readily
conceded that private industries
and enterprises of all kinds call for
training and experience and special
knowledge on the part of those who
conduct them; but Government business
is supposed to be so simple that
a wayfaring man, though a pronounced
fool, need not err therein.
There is more or less hypocrisy, however,
in the pretension. The real underlying
thought is that, outside of
the two great killing departments,
no very serious harm can be done by
official incompetence, and that the
great thing is to provide for "the
boys." No idea could be more false.
The evil that can be done by unwise
economic measures, for example, is
incalculable. The army and navy
are brought into action only when
the dogs of war have been let loose;
but the influence of the civil departments
of the Government acts unceasingly,
and touches the life of the
people at a thousand points.</p>

<p>In the matter of public education
science has never had the recognition
to which it is entitled; nor will it
have until the people as a whole know
better what science is&mdash;until they
cease to think of it as a thing of mysteries
and technicalities, and come to
understand that it is simply the organization
of knowledge and the rendering
of it available for guidance
in the business of life. Meantime,
wherever circumstances are favorable,
the education of the young, even
of the youngest, should be given as
far as possible a scientific character.
We are strongly inclined to the opinion
that, in a country whose fundamental
industry is agriculture, an effort
should be made in all schools to
impart a few sound elementary ideas
as to the principles of agriculture.
What better starting point could
there be for scientific instruction
than the soil out of which we derive,
mediately or immediately, all that
goes to sustain life? It seems to us
that no human being should be permitted
to be wholly ignorant of the
conditions upon which the successful
cultivation of the soil depends,
and we are persuaded that the subject
might, by proper treatment, be
made deeply interesting to the vast
majority of school children.</p>

<p>A prominent Englishman, Mr.
Boyd-Kinnear, has lately been discussing
this matter in a London paper.
He points out that a knowledge
of the scientific principles of agriculture
is of fundamental importance,
and that whatever else is
taught in the national schools, the
sciences on which farming rests&mdash;physics,
chemistry, mechanics, and
the physiology of plants and animals&mdash;should
hold a principal place. He
observes that in order to know agriculture
it is necessary to understand,
first of all, the elements and the action
of the soil and the air. There is
urgent need, he contends, for teaching
what is known on these subjects
and for pursuing research into the
much larger field of the unknown.
In these remarks we entirely concur,
and we believe that it would be a
happy thing for this country, and
for every country, if education could
be so administered that, instead of
tending, as it so often does, to separate
human beings from the soil, it
should tend to establish in their
minds a sense of their dependence on
it and an intelligent, if possible a
loving, interest in the operations by
which the living of the world is won
and the face of Nature is beautified.
Here, as we conceive, is where scientific
teaching should begin. Such
a system of instruction would do
much more than increase the intelligence
of the farming community,
though that would be a benefit of the
first magnitude; it would so transform
public opinion in general that
the divorce we now see between science
and the State would no longer
be possible. The whole national life
would be placed on a sounder basis;
and it would probably be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
that the result of doing other things
scientifically was to diminish very
greatly the importance of the arrangements
for scientific killing. A
nation governed by science would be
a peace-loving and peace-maintaining
nation.</p>


<h3><i>AGRICULTURE AND NATIONAL LIFE.</i></h3>

<p>Some very interesting points of
view are presented in an article on
the food supply of England which
appeared a few months ago in The
New Century Review of London.
The writer, Mr. Richard Higgs, Jr.,
is very unwilling to admit the commonly
accepted view that Great
Britain must be dependent upon
other countries for the food her people
require. He holds that all that
is required to make the production
of grain profitable in England is the
application of higher intelligence
and more businesslike methods to
the work of the farm. "Speaking
generally," he says, "agriculture has
been of late a despised industry; intellectual
activity has not been
brought to bear on it; the men of
force and enterprise have failed to
recognize that it offers an absolutely
unrivaled sphere for the exercise of
personal initiative, skill, and knowledge....
Agriculture has not been
regarded as a means of assisting
human development, but rather as a
hindrance to progress. A low type
of manhood and a slow, unprogressive
condition of life are usually regarded
as indispensable to agriculture,
and consequently it has been
neglected by reformers who desire to
further the progress of the race."</p>

<p>The writer proceeds to describe
the various ways in which, as he believes,
agriculture might be made
more profitable, partly through lowering
of the cost of production, and
partly by improvement of the yield;
and, finally, he sets forth the disagreeable
and very serious conclusions
which flow from the proposition&mdash;if
it is to be accepted as established&mdash;that
Great Britain can not feed
herself by the remunerative production
of wheat in the face of low
prices. In the first place, the national
policy must be one of "bluff
and weakness toward other nations:
bluff, because it will not answer our
purpose to appear weak; and weakness,
because, seeing that possible
enemies are our largest feeders, we
are not in a condition to deal with
other nations on equal terms, but
must ever face the galling necessity
of being dependent upon the good
will of a few powerful nations for
our daily bread." A nation so situated
must be "in the front rank of
the nations which are engaging in
the mad scramble after markets";
must give itself over "to all the
orthodox requirements of diplomacy
by engaging in bullying, cringing,
lying, deceit, and massacre, in order
to secure an outlet for its manufactured
goods." Such a fact further
implies "the eternal persistence on
the face of the land of those hideous
monstrosities&mdash;our manufacturing
towns; those excrescences which, like
the dragon of old, are daily vomiting
fire and smoke, and by their foulness
are blasting and cursing the lives
of the people and causing the physical,
mental, and moral deterioration
of the race.... It banishes the
poetry, the music, and the glories of
an agricultural life, and condemns
untold millions to the artificial and
unhealthy moral atmosphere of our
towns."</p>

<p>It may be said that all this has
not much application to the state of
things in these happy United States.
It has application to at least this
extent, that our towns too are becoming
bloated and our country places
starved. We are fully at one with
the writer in his estimate of the
agricultural life, and believe that no
greater service could be rendered to
any country than to place its agriculture
on the moral and intellectual,
as well as on the economic, level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
which it has a just claim to occupy.
It is the application of science to agriculture
that will bring about this
result.</p>

<h2>Scientific Literature.</h2>


<h3>SPECIAL BOOKS.</h3>

<p><i>The Theory of the Leisure Class</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> of Mr. <i>Thorstein Veblen</i> is primarily
an inquiry into the place and value of the leisure class as an economic factor
in modern life. Hardly less attention, however, is given to the origin
and line of derivation of the institution, and to features of social life not
commonly classed as economic, into the very heart of some of which the
study goes. The institution of the leisure class, which is defined generally
as that class whose occupation is not industrial, is found in its best development
at the higher stages of the barbarian culture, as in feudal Europe
or feudal Japan. Whichever way we go from this point it is modified.
Its origin appears at a very early stage in history, and appears in the germ
in the savage division of the occupations of men and women. The women
carried on the industries, and the men went to the hunt or to war&mdash;occupations
with which the idea of prowess or exploit was associated, giving the
stamp of aristocracy. In the highest development of this distinction, the
nonindustrial upper-class occupations may be roughly comprised under
the heads of government, warfare, religious observances, and sports. In
the sequence of cultural evolution the emergence of a leisure class coincides
with the beginning of ownership, ownership of women being one of
the most conspicuous forms in earlier times, then ownership of property
and its symbols. Among the signs of wealth are conspicuous leisure, which
includes social distinction and functions and conspicuous consumption,
or the possession of fine things not necessaries, and plenty of them. These
lead to the setting up of a pecuniary standard of living and pecuniary
canons of taste, and the adoption of dress as an expression of the pecuniary
culture. In the chapter on Industrial Exemption and Conservatism we
are introduced to the reason of conventionalism and of its power. "The
fact that the usages, actions, and views of the well-to-do leisure class acquire
the character of a prescriptive canon of conduct for the rest of society
gives added weight and reach to the conservative influence of that
class. It makes it incumbent upon all respectable people to follow their
lead." Hence it exerts a retarding influence on social development, stiffening
the resistance of all other classes against innovation. Further, the
code of proprieties in vogue at any given time or in any society has the
character of an organic whole, and any important infringement upon it
is likely to derange it. This conservative quality goes so far as to tend
toward spiritual survival and reversion. The idea of prowess survives in
our barbaric admiration of military exploits, in the taste for sports, and
in the gambling tendency, which is based on belief in luck and is enhanced
by the desire to triumph at the expense of another. A connection is traced
between the admiration of prowess and the cultivation of the devotional
spirit which, joined with the fondness for display, leads all worshipers
eventually to elaboration of rituals. A further development, classed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
Survivals of the Non-Invidious Interest, is that of beneficences. The
Higher Learning was primarily the exclusive privilege of the leisure class,
and has still attached to it a mass of ritual in the shape of paraphernalia,
ceremonies, degrees, and privileges which grow more elaborate as the college
and the community become richer. Devotion to classical learning,
which is practically useless, is a form of "conspicuous leisure" and "conspicuous
expenditure," but now encounters a rival in athletics, which is
equally useless and conspicuous and more costly.</p>

<p>The American Economic Association, at its meeting in Cleveland, Ohio,
in 1897, authorized the appointment of a committee to inquire into the
scope and method of the eleventh census, with a view of determining what
ought to be attempted in the twelfth. In order to make an adequate review
of the eleventh census this committee invited a certain number of critical
articles on particular portions of the work; and further, in order to discover
what might seem weak points in the work and what inquiries it might
seem desirable to elaborate in the twelfth census, addressed a circular letter
of questions to all the members of the association. Only about sixty replies
were received to the questions, but a generous response was made to the
invitations to contribute reviews, the result of which is a series of papers
by independent authors upon specific topics which are regarded as constituting
a very valuable commentary on the Federal census and on statistical
methods in general. These criticisms are now embodied in a book<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of
more than five hundred pages, containing twenty essays by authors each of
whom is specially interested in the particular topic of which he treats.
These articles include a general review of the statistics of population, by
Walter F. Wilcox, and special articles on the negro population, by W. Z.
Ripley; the North American Indians, by Franz Boas; Age, Sex, Dwellings,
and Families, and Urban Population, by George K. Holmes; Illiteracy
and Educational Statistics, by Davis R. Dewey; Statistics of Occupation,
by Richard Mayo-Smith; Various Aspects of the Vital and Social
Statistics, by Cressy L. Wilbur, Irving Fisher, Roland P. Falkner, and
Samuel M. Lindsay; of Agriculture and Farms, by N. I. Stone and David
Kelley; Transportation, by Emery R. Johnson and Walter E. Weyl; Manufactures,
by S. N. D. North, William M. Stewart, Worthington C. Ford,
and Charles J. Bullock; Wealth, Debt, and Taxation, by Carl C. Plehn;
Municipal Finance, by Henry B. Gardner; and the Scope and Method of
the Twelfth Census, by William C. Hunt. A number of general conclusions
are pointed out by the committee as deducible from the papers contributed
by these writers. The criticism throughout touches not so much
the accuracy of the census as the treatment of the data and the lack of
continuity from census to census&mdash;both defects believed to be largely due
to the insufficient time allowed by law for preparing plans and schedules.
The work of the census is believed to be seriously impeded by the number
and variety of the investigations ordered, in consequence of which fundamental
inquiries can not receive attention. A number of subordinate
inquiries might advantageously be transferred to established bureaus or
departments under whose scope they would properly fall, and some of which
already publish annual volumes of kindred statistics. Among classes of defects
or weaknesses in method pointed out in the criticisms are a lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
comparability in data from census to census, lack of co-ordination, certain
specified faults in method, and faults in the textual analysis of the figures.
A summary of the answers received to the circular letter of questions is appended,
particularly of the answers to the request to suggest what special
information might be furnished by the twelfth census which is not in the
eleventh. Many of the writers point to the desirability of a permanent
census bureau. The committee has a right to congratulate itself, as it
does, "upon this noteworthy collection of papers&mdash;the result of the scientific
zeal and effort of so many men."</p>


<h3>GENERAL NOTICES.</h3>

<p>The qualification of Mr. <i>Frederick
A. Ober</i> to write a book about <i>Puerto
Rico and its Resources</i><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> is indicated by
the facts that he visited every point of
importance on the island in 1880, and
revisited it as West Indian Commissioner
for the Columbian Exposition.
To the fruits of observations made during
these two visits he has added information
gathered from the books that
have been written about Puerto Rico by
Spanish and other officers. A plain, concise
account of the island is presented,
without sensational exaggerations and
free from apparent padding. It begins
with the consideration and estimation of
the commercial and strategic value of the
island. Next its coastal features, rivers&mdash;of
which it seems to have a relatively
good supply&mdash;and harbors are described.
Then the climate, which is "hot and
moist, yet in the main less injurious to
the health of white people than that of
adjacent islands"; seasons, which are
not very variable; and hurricanes, which
appear to be rather an important feature.
As to products, they are of course
tropical, and grow, as in Mexico, in three
zones of climate and vegetation. Considering
these more specially a chapter is
given to Sugar, Tobacco, Coffee, and Cacao;
another to Fruits, Spices, Cereals,
and Food Plants; and a third to Dyes,
Drugs, Woods, and Minerals. The chapter
on Natural History includes accounts of
game and insect pests. The topographic
description begins with San Juan, the
capital, and takes in the cities and
towns of the coast and the inland towns
and routes of travel. A few words are
devoted to the government as it has
been, and the general characteristics of
the people are briefly sketched. Accounts
of their foods, drinks, diversions,
etc., are given, after which the author
passes to the Indians of Puerto Rico.
Two chapters relate to the general and
the recent history of the island respectively.
Considerable information of a
statistical character is included in an
appendix.</p>

<p>President <i>D. S. Jordan's Footnotes
to Evolution</i><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> is made up of popular essays
or addresses on the general subject
of organic evolution which were given
originally as oral lectures before University
Extension Societies. Three of
them have been also published in this
Monthly, and as many in another magazine.
Besides the author's own twelve
essays, he has inserted in this volume
three other papers of special importance,
setting forth the present state of knowledge
concerning the methods of evolution
and of heredity. These are on
the Factors of Organic Evolution as displayed
in the Process of Development, by
Prof. E. G. Conklin; the Physical Basis
of Heredity, by Prof. F. M. McFarland;
on The Testimony from Paleontology, by
Prof. J. P. Smith. President Jordan's
own essays begin with a discussion of
the kinship of life. This is followed by
three articles on evolution, relating to
its nature, elements, and factors from
the point of view of embryology, and an
application of the subject in the paper
on The Heredity of Richard Roe, in
which the rise of race types from the
survival of the existing race with its best
results modified and preserved by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
survival of the fittest is illustrated. In
the seventh essay certain facts of animal
distribution as related to the origin of
species are considered; in the eighth
(Latitude and Vertebrata) the curious
biological problem of the possession of
more numerous vertebr&aelig; by northern
than by tropical fishes is considered&mdash;a
problem the solution of which on any
other hypothesis than that of the derivation
of species would be impossible.
The evolution of mind is then taken up
as the sum total of all psychic changes,
actions, and reactions, and this development
is extended to nations the laws of
whose greatness "expand themselves
from the laws which govern the growth
of the single cell." In the essay on Degeneration
a lesson is drawn in favor
of individual initiative. Hereditary Inefficiency
is discussed in view of the danger
from pauperism. Some of the aspects
of the woman question are considered in
another of the essays. In the paper on
The Stability of Truth some recent
enunciations of Lord Salisbury, Mr. Balfour,
and Haeckel respecting science are
criticised. The last essay is on The Struggle
for Realities, and concerns the relations
of science and conservatism, the
Church, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Robert P. Porter's</i> volume on <i>Industrial
Cuba</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> deals with living questions
of the island. It aims to give a
description of Cuba as it appeared to the
author when he visited it in the fall
of 1898 as special commissioner of the
United States to report on its industrial,
commercial, and financial condition. It
is the result of nearly seven months' inquiry
and hard work, in which the island
was visited three times, more than five
hundred witnesses were examined, and
"numerous statements" were studied
and analyzed. Among the special subjects
treated of are the political and economical
condition of Cuba, the outlook
for labor, the population, sanitary work,
Colonel Waring's report, municipal problems
in Havana, banks and currency,
the revenue and tariffs, commerce, sugar,
tobacco, mines and mining, agriculture
and stock, timber and fruit, transportation,
navigation, education and religion,
and the outlook for the future.</p>

<p>Naturalists and bibliophiles have reason
to be grateful to Mr. <i>Call</i> for his
verbatim reproduction of Rafinesque's
<i>Ichthyologia Ohioensis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The book is of
importance as constituting, in the language
of the editor, the foundation of
fresh-water ichthyology in America. No
book dealing specifically with the Ohio
Valley area as a region has since been
published. The original description of
many fish forms which are now recognized
by ichthyologists as good species
were first given in this book, and
many have not since been reprinted.
Further, the book contains the first
and most complete description, to date,
of the Ohio River from Pittsburg down,
with notices of all its tributaries. Its
value as a book about fishes is not
limited to the Ohio River, for the species
of that stream are found, to a
greater or less extent, throughout the
Mississippi Valley, so that it is in effect
a necessity to all students of the
fresh-water fishes of that territory. The
editor regrets that Rafinesque did not
preserve in some manner the types of his
genera, instead of which, when the technical
description was completed and
some common form, if one was known,
was referred to, the specimen was discarded
or rejected. Hence his descriptions
can not be compared conveniently
with prepared specimens in cabinets or
with descriptions made from them, but
the student must go to the river and look
up the living fish. The original papers
of Rafinesque on fishes were published in
The Western Review and Miscellaneous
Magazine, Lexington, Ky., in 1819, 1820,
and 1821. The matter was then arranged
in book form from the same type.
Two different systems of pagination resulted.
These have both been indicated
in the present edition by the insertion
of the numbers at their proper places.
The reprint is an exact copy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
original, including even typographical
errors, excepting only the style of type.
Of the original edition only eight copies
are known to exist, so that the republication
was desirable to preserve the
book, as well as for the facilitation of
reference, and of this only two hundred
and fifty numbered copies are printed for
the market.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Douglas Houghton Campbell</i> has
endeavored, in his <i>Lectures on the Evolution
of Plants</i>,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to present in as untechnical
a manner as seemed feasible
the more striking facts bearing upon the
evolution of plant forms, believing that
it will fill an existing want among English
text-books. The substance of the
work was given originally in the form
of lectures to classes in Leland Stanford
Junior University. After an introduction,
in which a few fundamental principles
are presented, elementary structures
are defined, and accepted classification
is mentioned, the conditions of
plant life are treated of as relating to
food substances, water, life, division of
labor, and movements, of which all
plants exhibit more or less marked ones,
that may be spontaneous. While in the
simple unicellular plants all the functions
are performed by a single cell, a
gradual division of labor takes place as
we go up, first in a separation of the
vegetative and reproductive cells, and
later a further specialization of both
vegetative and reproductive functions,
culminating in the seed plant. This
course is described as exemplified in
the simplest forms of life, alg&aelig;, fungi,
mosses and liverworts, ferns, and seed
plants of the different classes. The study
of the geological relations, fragmentary
as their teachings are, has yielded most
important evidence for tracing the succession
of plant forms. Observation of
geographical distribution casts much
light on the subject. The relations of
animals and plants have an important
bearing. The influence of the environment
embraces many factors, and is often
shown in conspicuous features of form
and structure adapting plants to certain
sorts of conditions and enabling them
to resist others. Plants have thus succeeded
in adapting themselves to almost
every environment.</p>

<p>Prof. <i>Augustus de Morgan's</i> book
<i>On the Study and Difficulties of Mathematics</i>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
though originally published
more than sixty years ago, is still fresh
and suggestive and full of matter valuable
alike to students and teachers, and
possesses qualities of clearness of reasoning
and intelligibility from which many
mathematical treatises are unfortunately
free. Its purpose is to notice particularly
several important points in the
principles of algebra and geometry which
have not obtained their due importance
in elementary works in those sciences.
Metaphysical points are avoided, and the
method of explaining by reference to
some particular problem, with hints as
to more general adaptation, is adopted.
Among the points taken up and classified
are the nature and objects of mathematics,
arithmetical and algebraic notation,
rules and principles, equations, the
negative sign, roots and logarithms, geometrical
subjects, and application of algebra
to measurements. The editor of
the present edition, Mr. Thomas J. McCormack,
has corrected the errata of
the old edition and incorporated such
changes as the progress of time and
mathematical literature have made seem
proper. An excellent portrait of De Morgan
is given.</p>

<p>The purpose of <i>Carpenter's Geographical
Reader, North America</i> (American
Book Company), is to give its readers a
living knowledge of some of the wonders
of the country and continent in which
they live. They are taken by the author,
Mr. <i>Frank G. Carpenter</i>, on a personally
conducted tour through the
most characteristic parts of the American
continent, studying the most interesting
features of life and work among
the people, learning how they are governed,
and how they make their living.
Much information is also given concerning
the natural resources and the physical
features of the countries visited.</p>

<p>The <i>Japan-American Commercial
Journal</i> is a monthly periodical started
with the beginning of the year, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
an especial view to the opening of the
empire of Japan to unrestricted foreign
trade and residence, for the advancement
of the reciprocal interests of Japan
and the United States. It is printed in
English and Japanese, and is published
at Tokio by the Japan-American Commercial
and Industrial Association, for
$2.50 a year.</p>

<p><i>The Anglo-Saxon</i> is a monthly magazine,
the first number of which is dated
November, 1898, "devoted to the identity
of the Anglo-Saxon race with the
house of Israel." It is edited by <i>George
E. Inglis</i>, and published by the Anglo-Saxon
Publishing Company, Chicago.
The title of the first paragraph&mdash;"Cui
bono"&mdash;seems to us to suggest a very
appropriate question. The argument
seems to be that the house of Israel
was appointed to universal dominion,
and the Anglo-Saxon race, between England
and the United States, with its late
war "as nearly a Christian war as any
war might be," is getting it.</p>

<p>Among the general papers in the second
volume, containing Parts II and III,
of the <i>Report of the Commissioner of
Education</i> for 1896-'97 are those on Federal
and State Aid to Higher Education,
the First Common Schools of New England,
the Learned Professions and Social
Control, and the Beginnings of the Common-School
System in the South. Statistics
of foreign universities are given,
with a paper on the Teaching of Geography
in certain foreign countries, and
consular reports on educational topics.
Professor Boas's paper on the Growth of
Toronto Children is included. Educational
matters of interest in various
States are reported upon. An Eskimo
vocabulary is introduced. A special report
on education in Alaska appears.
Part III is devoted to statistical matter.</p>

<p>The <i>Occult Science Library</i> is a
course of seven essays on the subject of
practical occultism by <i>Ernest Loomis</i>.
The author assumes that the rules based
on the occult principles of Nature would,
if fully applied, enable any person to
invoke the assistance of occult forces
in every practical rule of life, and that
they may with like success be applied
in matters of health, the acquisition of
knowledge, the formation of plans, and
the solution of religious and ethical
enigmas. The publishers claim that the
maxims of the book have proved their
efficiency to the satisfaction of thousands
who have read them. (Published
by Ernest Loomis &amp; Co., Chicago.)</p>

<p>Mr. <i>James G. Needham</i> has furnished,
in <i>Outdoor Studies</i> (American Book
Company), one of the fullest and most
systematic guides or "reading books,"
as he calls this one, for Nature study
that we have seen. Recognizing that
there is no lack, in numbers, of books
offering object lessons, etc., for children
of the earlier years intervening between
the primary and the high school, he has
prepared this book to supply for the
later years of that period "a few lessons
of greater continuity, calling for more
persistence of observation and introducing
a few of the simpler of our modern
conceptions of Nature at large." The lessons
presuppose some years of experience
of life and some previous training in observation;
they are given simply for the
sake of the interest and educative value
of the facts and phenomena of Nature
which they set forth; and they have
been written more for the boys and girls
than for the teachers. The things described&mdash;birds,
insects, plants, etc.&mdash;are
such as can be seen anywhere. Mr.
Needham tells how to study them and
learn what they mean.</p>

<p>In <i>Commissioner Hume, a Story of
New York Schools</i>, a sequel to Roderick
Hume, the Story of a New York Teacher,
Mr. <i>C. W. Bardeen</i> has undertaken to
give a picture of rural New York schools,
or rather of the administration of school
affairs by commissioners as they were in
1875, and he declares it to be accurate.
He represents, however, that the general
tone of the commissioners has vastly
changed in the period that has intervened
since then, and the conditions described
in the volume no longer prevail.
The book is offered, therefore, as a contribution
to educational history. (Published
by C. W. Bardeen, Syracuse,
N. Y.)</p>

<p>The southern half of Missouri and
the Black Hills of South Dakota offer
exceptionally delightful regions for the
study of caves, or speleology, as well as
of geology and geography. Each of these
regions has its peculiar geological history
and its own scenery, and possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
a number of truly wonderful caves.
Some of the more important of these
caves and the scenery amid which they
lie are described by Mrs. <i>Luella Agnes</i>
Owen in the book <i>Cave Regions of the
Black Hills</i> (Cincinnati: the Editor
Publishing Company), and we have been
much interested in reading the accounts.
The descriptions are introduced by summaries
of the methods of the formation
of caves and of the results of the geological
and topographical explorations
of the regions in which they are situated,
as presented in official reports and scientific
memoirs. The descriptions are for
the most part relations of the author's
personal explorations of the caves. The
most important of these caves are Marble
Cave, "the finest yet explored in
Missouri," and Wind Cave, in South Dakota,
said to be the largest known after
the Mammoth Cave. Others are Fairy,
Powell, Stone County, Oregon County
Caves and the Grand Gulf in Missouri,
and the Onyx and Crystal Caves in
South Dakota. Many illustrations are
given. The author has fine descriptive
powers, but her literary style needs discipline.
She is the first American, and
the only woman, so far, elected to membership
in the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Speleologie of
Paris.</p>

<p>A valuable paper on <i>Sympathetic
Strikes and Sympathetic Lockouts</i> is
published by Mr. <i>Fred S. Hall</i> as the
first number of the eleventh volume of
the Columbia University Studies in History,
Economics, and Public Law. In
it, the author having fixed the definition
of sympathetic strikes and lockouts as
distinguished from those not sympathetic,
and having found the difference
between a strike and a lockout, discusses
the origin and development of the
two sympathetic movements, analyzes
them, and forecasts the future as it is
indicated by the past. Illustrations are
freely drawn from the important strikes
and lockouts that have occurred in the
United States and abroad for a number
of years past.</p>

<p><i>The Year Book of Colorists and Dyers</i>,
in the opinion of the author, Mr. <i>Harwood
Huntington</i>, supplies a want, for,
so far as he is aware, there are no other
portable works in the English language
to which the color-chemist can refer and
find the information which he requires
the oftenest. The object of the present
publication is to meet the demand for a
review of the advances made annually
in the special field worked in by dyers
and colorists&mdash;in the bleaching, dyeing,
printing, and finishing of textiles&mdash;and
it endeavors to do this with accuracy
and brevity. (Published by the author,
New York.)</p>

<p>The first number of <i>The Socialist Almanac
and Treasury of Facts</i> has been
issued in accordance with a decision of
the National Convention of the Socialist
Labor Party, held in New York in July,
1896. It has been prepared by <i>Lucien
Sanial</i>, to whom the task was assigned
by the National Executive Committee.
A large proportion of it is historical,
and consists mainly of monographs presenting
views of the movements and condition
of "militant socialism" in Germany,
Austria, Italy, Spain, and Belgium,
from its beginning to the present
day. Special attention is invited by the
author to the monographs on Italy and
Spain as tracing the struggle between
socialism and anarchism to its beginning.
The second part of the book contains
statistical matter and comments
on economical and social conditions,
which, if the argument on "Who owns
the Savings?" is a specimen of its quality,
must be accepted with many reservations.</p>

<p>Prof. William Wadden Turner, a native
of England who came to this country
at an early age, became an eminent
scholar in Oriental literature, and in
1842 a professor of that subject in Union
Theological Seminary. He was called
thence to Washington in 1852 to organize
the library of the Patent Office, where
his work was of great value. Thence he
was taken by Professor Baird to catalogue
and arrange the library of the
Smithsonian Institution. He associated
his sister with him in this work and as
recorder of scientific collections and exchanges
in 1858. She continued there
after his death the next year, and served
the library faithfully and efficiently, going
with it to the Congressional Library
when it was removed there, till 1886,
when she resigned on account of age.
She died in 1896. A <i>Memorial</i> of the
two and of their elder sister Susan has
been prepared by Mrs. <i>Caroline H. Dall</i>
and has been printed privately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of <i>What is This?</i> after a
brief discussion of the personality of
Jesus and the present degenerate condition
of Christianity, goes on to say: "We
must have another revelation, therefore.
It seems to be a necessity. But what
troubles me is this: can it be possible
that any part of this revelation can come
through one as humble as myself?
What have I seen and what have I
heard?... I have often pondered the
great questions of man's origin and future;
never until now, never until I heard
this voice, have I had any glimmer of a
solution of this great puzzle. I know
I am nothing, but can not the Supreme
Being use a mere nothing to accomplish
his purpose?" Notwithstanding the author's
avowed unworthiness, he seems
to have been selected, and we have from
his pen a new and considerably detailed
book of genesis.</p>

<p><b>Climate and Acclimatization.</b>&mdash;In
view of the rapid growth of West Indian
and South American commerce and the
considerable emigration to Cuba and
neighboring islands, which our present
relations with them will probably bring
about, the following extracts from an
editorial in the London Lancet are of
interest: "The American nation has entered
upon a new and, in a sense, imperial
policy, which may be regarded
as forming an epoch in its history.
This brings it face to face with the
problem of colonization and acclimatization&mdash;a
problem which we have had
to confront long ago and toward the solution
of which we have ever since been
slowly fighting our way by following on
the lines of the best practical measures
of hygiene known to us. 'The white
man's burden' has proved a tragical one
in its drain on the life of the young manhood
of this country, notwithstanding
the very large measure of success which
has attended our sanitary efforts in this
direction. The Americans, having taken
up their burden, will, no doubt, like the
practical people they are, set about their
task in a practical way. The four principal
factors in the production of climate,
according to Buchan, are distance
from the equator, height above the sea,
distance from the sea, and prevailing
winds. The equatorial region has the
most equable climate; tropical regions
have much greater variations of temperature
than those near the equator, and
have a hot and cold or dry and rainy
season. The isothermal lines of mean
temperature do not supply a graduated
measure of the effects of temperature on
animal life. So far as climate is concerned,
no single meteorological influence
appears, however, to equal the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
temperature upon health, and its range
is of more importance than its mean.
The European under a tropical climate
suffers from an&aelig;mia, diseases of the digestive
system, especially of the liver,
from malaria, dysentery, typhoid fever,
and yellow fever. It is not at all easy
to say, however, how much of the excess
of mortality of Europeans in tropical
and subtropical countries is simply attributable
to climatic heat <i>per se</i>, and is
consequently inevitable and not the effect
of malaria, or how much of it is the
direct consequence of habits of life and
of the neglect of sanitary laws and of
personal hygiene. As Arnould rightly
said, the <i>habitudes alimentaires</i> of the
Anglo-Saxon constitute one of the stumbling-blocks
to health, but by far the
most important is malaria, compared
with which the rest are relatively
insignificant. Mr. Chamberlain was right
when he said the other day that 'the
man who shall successfully grapple with
this foe to humanity and shall find a
cure for malarial fever and shall make
the tropics livable for the white man,
will do more for the world and more for
the British Empire than the man who
adds a new province to the wide dominions
of the Queen.'"</p>

<p>"<b>Picture Telegraphy.</b>"&mdash;The following
account of the new so-called picture
telegraphy is from the New York
Electrical World and Engineer: "The
apparatus consists of a receiver and
transmitter, similar in appearance and
in mechanism. The picture to be transmitted
is drawn on a heavy piece of
metal foil, the lines of the drawing being
made with an insulating ink. The foil
is then secured on the circumference of
a horizontal cylinder on the transmitter,
the cylinder being of about the size of
a typewriter rubber roller. There is a
similar cylinder on the receiver, on
whose surface is clamped the paper upon
which the drawing is to be reproduced;
over this is superposed carbon paper,
which is covered in turn by a sheet of
thin paper. A stylus actuated by an
electro-magnet is adjusted close to the
surface of the latter, and each time a
current is passed through the electro-magnet
the stylus is forcibly pressed
against the moving surface of the cylinder,
and a corresponding mark is made
on the two sheets in contact with the
carbon paper; the outer sheet serves
merely to offer a smooth surface to the
stylus and to enable the operator to see
that the picture is being properly reproduced.
The transmitting cylinder passes
under a similar stylus, which latter
closes the circuit between the receiving
and transmitting ends when it rests upon
the foil, and opens the circuit when it
passes over the lines drawn with insulating
ink, in the latter case actuating
the stylus magnet at the receiving end,
which leaves a mark on the paper of the
receiving cylinder in the form of a line
corresponding to the width of the insulation
over which the transmitting stylus
is passing. The stylus at each end of
the line is simultaneously advanced at
the end of each revolution of the cylinders
by a screw of small pitch. From the
description it will be seen that if the surface
of the foil on the transmitting cylinder
were entirely insulated the receiving
stylus would merely draw a number
of parallel lines on the paper corresponding
to the turns of the screw, and separated
a distance corresponding to the
pitch of the screw and the angle through
which it is turned at each operation.
Four different rates of advance may be
given to the stylus, corresponding to as
many different angles of advance that
may, by appropriate mechanism, be
given to the screw. The two cylinders
have synchronous motion, so that all the
marks or lines on the receiving cylinder
correspond to widths of insulating ink
traced over on the transmitting cylinder.
Synchronism is obtained as follows: Connected
with both receiver and transmitter
is an electric motor which, at the
end of every revolution of the cylinder,
raises a weight, which acts on a clock
train when falling and thus gives motion
to the cylinder. At the end of each revolution
of the transmitting cylinder a
contact is made which locks for an instant
the receiving cylinder when it arrives
in a position corresponding to a
similar position of the transmitting cylinder.
Thus it will be seen that each
cylinder begins its revolution from identical
positions and at the same instant,
and as the clockwork of both receiver
and transmitter are duplicates, approximate
synchronism is maintained during
a revolution. Owing to the use of carbon
paper, the lines made by the receiver
are of considerable width, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
consequence that the resulting picture does
not have the appearance of being made
up of parallel lines, as in the case of reproductions
by the original Caselli picture
telegraph, of which the system described
is a modification. The Hummell
apparatus appears to be entirely practicable,
the simplicity of its synchronizing
mechanism giving it a great advantage
over former types of Caselli picture
telegraphs. The apparatus has been
worked duplex with success. In one instance,
a few days ago, a picture was
sent from New York to St. Louis while
one was being received from the same
place in New York, the latter picture in
addition being received simultaneously
at Boston."</p>

<p><b>The Charges on Country Checks:
an Economic Mistake.</b>&mdash;An article in
the May issue of the Yale Review, discussing
the recent adoption by the New
York banks of a rule imposing a "collection
charge" on all country checks handled,
takes the view that the new rule is
a mistake. After reviewing the history
and present position of the Bank of England;
calling attention to the fact that
although it is a private enterprise its position
is used as a governor, so to speak,
of English finance; the similarity to it
in position and power for good or evil of
the association of banks known as the
New York Clearing House is pointed
out; the review goes on to say: "In the
associated banks of New York, as in the
Bank of England, is kept a very large
part of the reserve on which the great
financial transactions of a whole country
are based. The system of 'reserve cities'
for holding large deposit accounts of
country banks, in which New York is
by far the most important center, is but
the recognition in the national banking
law of this great fact of a central reserve,
and the power of utilizing such
deposits, indirectly extended by the law
which allows and encourages country
banks to hold a large part of their legal
reserve in the form of deposits in New
York, probably constitutes a much more
valuable privilege than the rights of note
issue enjoyed by the Bank of England.
In extraordinary emergencies the parallel
is even closer. Just as the Bank of
England is encouraged to expect a modification
of the restrictions on its right of
note issue, as a means of extending its
effective currency reserve in times of
panic, so the New York banks, by their
system of clearing-house loan certificates,
are encouraged and expected to evade
those provisions of our national banking
laws which restrict their power of
issuing notes to meet an emergency....
The exercise of this function of holding
a reserve for clearing the business of the
country is attended with some expense,
as well as with much profit. One of the
most vexatious of these expenses has
been the cost of collecting country
checks.... Under these circumstances
they have adopted a rule imposing such
charges on country checks as to compel
a large part of the remittances to be
made in the form of bank drafts on New
York city, rather than individual checks
on country banks supposed to have accounts
with some New York bank. This
rule will save the New York banks
something like two million dollars annually.
It will not prevent any solvent
man from making remittances,
for if he has a deposit in his local
bank and his local bank has a deposit
in New York he can buy a draft to
send as a remittance, which will pass
through the New York Clearing House
without question or expense. Yet, in
spite of these plausible arguments, we
believe the action of the New York
banks to be a mistake of very serious
magnitude, an inconvenience to the public,
a probable loss to deposit banking in
the long run, and, worst of all, a serious
blow to the cause of sound currency
throughout the country. It seems to us,
in short, a case where narrower duties
and economics have been allowed to
crowd broader ones out of sight." The
review then goes on to show how great
an amount of inconvenience and loss of
time in the aggregate the new rule is
going to cause, and finally says: "In a
popular government the greatest safeguard
against soft money&mdash;we may fairly
say the <i>only</i> real safeguard&mdash;is to prevent
the growth of a demand for soft
money. And of all the means of prevention
at our command the most effective
is the encouragement of the habit of paying
by checks. The habit of paying by
check is very general in all large business
centers, and has been rapidly extending
into the smaller centers, and the most
serious public danger in the action of
the New York banks is that it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
likely to deal a severe blow to such progress."</p>

<p><b>La Nature's Second Scientific
Excursion.</b>&mdash;A second scientific excursion
to an interesting district of France is
planned, by M. Henri de Parville, of <i>La
Nature</i>, to start from Bayonne August
25th. It will spend about two weeks,
following the chain of the Pyrenees from
the ocean to the Mediterranean. Among
objects of interest enumerated are the
scenery at Biarritz, Pau, Cauterets, and
Bigorre; fine architecture at Toulouse,
Carcassonne, Elne, etc.; glacial phenomena
and thermal waters along the whole
mountain chain; manufactories, including
iron works at Bouchain, woolen
mills at Bigorre, cigarette factories at
Perpignan, and the Arago Maritime
Laboratory and the sanitarium at Banyuls.
The excursion will be "personally
conducted" by the eminent anthropologist
and arch&aelig;ologist, M. E. Cartaillac.
The excursion last year, to the
Central Plateau and the Tarn, was an
eminent success. The programme of the
present one seems equally attractive.
M. de Parville and his associates deserve
great credit for their sagacity and enterprise
in inaugurating these excursions,
which now promise to become annual.
We can conceive nothing more profitable
and conducive to real pleasure in a vacation
than the tour in the company of men
having a common interest in the pursuit
of knowledge of Nature and art, through
such magnificent regions as that of the
Pyrenees or through a country so full of
natural wonders and novelties as that of
last year's excursion. And it will be an
incalculable advantage to be under the
guidance of so eminent a student and
one so familiar with the remarkable features
and the antiquities of southern
France as M. Cartaillac.</p>

<p><b>The American Association Meeting.</b>&mdash;The
forty-eighth annual meeting
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science will be held at Columbus,
Ohio, August 19th to 26th. The
association headquarters will be in University
Hall, of the Ohio State University,
and the headquarters of the council
will be at the Chittenden Hotel.

Receptions and shorter excursions will
be provided at hours that will not conflict
with the appointments of the association.</p>

<p><b>The Desire for Notoriety a Cause
of Crime.</b>&mdash;Under the title <i>Luccheni
Redivivus</i> the London Lancet gives some
interesting psychological data which
have been obtained since the imprisonment
of Luccheni, the assassin of the
Austrian Empress. Twice since his trial
and conviction he has attempted suicide.
Within the last few days (May 13th) his
moral condition has undergone a change
confirmatory in a significant degree of
the diagnosis which found vanity or
megalomania at the root of his crime. The
cantonal juge d'instruction in an attempt
to ascertain if possible his associates
in the crime, visited him in his
cell and approached the subject with
what seemed to himself due dexterity
and caution. At once the previously
downcast and abject creature brightened
up, his eyes sparkling with gratified self-importance.
"<i>I giornali riparlano di
me?</i>" (So the journals are talking of me
again) he exclaimed interrogatively. The
judge disclosed the object of his visit.
Luccheni thereupon dallied with his
interlocutor, smiling at his reminiscences
of the crime, assuming airs of reticence,
even indulging in self-contradiction to
tease if not torment his judicial antagonist.
It was learned, however, that in
the preliminaries leading up to the assassination
he really had accomplices; beyond
this nothing new was elicited from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
him. The point of chief importance, however,
to be observed in this account is the
large part which vanity and a desire for
the widespread public attention which
such crimes bring about plays in reconciling
the criminal to his fate, and even
leading to the commission of the crime
in cases where the mental balance is very
unstable. Hence this class of criminals
should always be tried and punished
with as little publicity as possible, not
only because this policy deprives the
individual of a show, with himself as
the center, but also because every such
public trial is liable to lead to the commission
of similar crimes by other mentally
unsound degenerates, who are sure
to attend such spectacles whenever it is
possible.</p>

<p><b>Bounties and Free Trade.</b>&mdash;Much
discussion is going on in England over
the question of bounties and the propriety
of putting a tariff on those imported
articles which, owing to bounties
or other form of government aid at their
place of manufacture, can be sold "too
cheaply." The following paragraphs are
taken from an article in the London
Spectator: "In our opinion there can be
no question between the policy of free
and open market and the policy of only
allowing goods to be sold here 'at the
natural price of the world's market.'
We hold that the maintenance of an
open and unhindered market is essential
to our welfare; ... that is the real principle
involved, and that is the ground on
which this question of bounties must be
fought out. It is not Cobdenism or free
trade that is involved, but that which
underlies them both&mdash;the great principle
of the free and open market.... We
attach such immense importance to the
open market because we believe not
only that our internal prosperity is essentially
bound up with the right, not
merely of consumers, but of producers,
to buy as cheaply as they can and where
and how they will, but that the empire
itself rests upon the preservation of a
free and open market. Mr. Morley never
spoke a truer word than when he insisted
that Cobden and Bright and the old free
traders were empire builders. That they
were so and that our empire could not
possibly have grown up except with the
help of free trade and a market always
open must be clear to all whose eyes are
not blinded by that evil and foolish spirit
of commercial jealousy under which a
man, in order to injure his neighbor,
wounds himself. Free trade made our empire
possible and created what the world
before had never seen, overwhelming
commercial power wielded without jealousy
or narrowness and based on wide
and liberal ideas. How long would our
colonies have tolerated the connection
with us had we been forever worrying
them with tariffs and excluding this or
that product because it was unnaturally
cheap?... As it is, we bid all men welcome
in our markets and none are aggrieved....
Foreign powers may hate
us for our wealth and prosperity, but not
one of them would care to spoil their best
market. How would the commerce of
France, or Germany, or Russia get on if
England were ruined and the English
market destroyed? The principle of
maintaining a free and open market,
coupled with our moral and physical energy,
and our liberal aims and aspirations
have given us a great and splendid
empire. Are we to risk its destruction
because the sugar refiners grumble, and
because the words of Cobden on another
subject may possibly be interpreted to
show that he would not, were he alive,
have voted against the imposition of
countervailing duties?"</p>

<p><b>Forest and Animal Life of the
Catskills.</b>&mdash;The interior region of the
Catskill Mountains surrounding Kaaterskill
Junction is assigned, by Dr. E. A.
Means in a paper of the United States
National Museum, to the Canadian
faunal region, with a slight mixture of
the Alleghanian in the farming lands
on the banks of Schoharie Creek. A few
mammals of the Upper Austral zones,
however, such as the New England cottontail,
the deer mouse, and the gray
fox, appear to have extended their ranges
into the locality by following up the
clearings. Though the region is now
again well wooded, only the barest tags
and remnants yet remain of the splendid
forests that once covered the area.
All is second growth except in the rockiest
gulches, whence the lumber can not
be extracted, and about the rocky summits
of a few mountains of the East Jewett
ranges. While the original forests
seem to have been of conifers, the woods
are now very thoroughly mixed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
succession of trees according to altitudes,
with its strongly marked division
lines, is no longer seen. Specimens of fifty-eight
species of trees and shrubs have
been collected and placed in the National
Museum. Only ten species of mollusks,
one crustacean (the common crawfish),
probably a dozen fishes (the author identifies
eight and mentions others), eight
batrachians, two snakes, and a turtle
have been found. Of mammals, thirty-five
species are described as known to
occur at the present time, and eight as
of doubtful occurrence now.</p>

<p><b>Geology of Block Island.</b>&mdash;In a
study of the geology and natural history
of Block Island, of which Arthur Hollick
gives a summary in the Annals of
the New York Academy of Sciences, the
most important problem was whether
the Amboy clay series was represented
in the island. Of fifteen species of fossil
leaves and fruit capable of identification,
represented by about twenty-five specimens,
at least nine were typical of the
Amboy flora. Observations on dip and
strike of strata tended to emphasize the
fact of contortion of glacial action, the
dip in all cases being toward the north,
indicating that the strata had been
pushed southward in a series of overthrust
folds by the advancing ice front.
The flora may be divided physiographically
into that of the hills, the peat bogs
and pond holes, the salt marshes, the
sand dunes, and the salt water. Trees
are rare, and such vegetation as is dependent
on forestal conditions is absent.
The bulk of the surface is that of a typical
morainal region, with rounded hills
and corresponding depressions, many
of the depressions being occupied by
swamps or ponds, often without any visible
outlet. Running streams are few
and insignificant, and permanent springs
occur only in a limited number of localities.
The soil is bowlder till and gravel,
with sand in the dunes and beaches, and
there are no outcrops of rock. The flora
is morainal in its general character, except
in the peat bogs and on the limited
sand dunes and sea-beach areas, and has
its nearest analogue in that of Montauk
Point. "In fact, if we could imagine
Montauk Point to be despoiled of its few
remaining trees and converted into an
island it would bear a striking resemblance,
geologically and botanically, to
Block Island." Considering the geological
features of Long Island, Block Island,
Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket,
and comparing their floras, we
find that all except Block Island have
some of the plain region remaining with
them, on which a characteristic flora
finds a home. Block Island has lost all
its plain region and accompanying flora,
and is now merely an isolated portion of
the terminal moraine, with small areas
of modern sand beach and dune formations,
affording a home only for such
species as can exist under such conditions.
The island appears to have been
extensively wooded before it was settled,
and large stumps, together with roots
and branches, are found in some of the
peat bogs. The scarcity of animal life
on the island is sure at once to attract
the attention of the observer from the
mainland. Tree-living birds are absent,
but robins, bank swallows, red-winged
blackbirds, and meadow larks occur with
some frequency. Among mollusks, the
periwinkle of the Old World, an importation
or migration, is the most abundant.
Frogs and spotted turtles are
plentiful, and a few small striped snakes
were seen by Mr. Hollick. The arch&aelig;ology
of the island is being studied by persons
specially interested in the subject.</p>

<p><b>The Claims of the High School.</b>&mdash;In
considering the right of the public
high school to be a just charge upon the
public treasury, Mr. Frank A. Hill, of
the Massachusetts State Board of Education,
finds that less than one fifth of
the school money raised in the State is
expended on account of these schools,
whereas if the number of pupils in each
of the thirteen grades of school was
equal and the money was evenly divided,
the higher grades would be entitled to
four thirteenths, or nearly one third of
it. To an objection sometimes raised
against the high-school system that the
"toiling millions" will have no use for
more than the teaching of the elementary
grades, Mr. Hill asks, Who has a
right to decide whether one child shall
have a greater or less amount of instruction
than another? "And so freedom of
choice, when the question of what one's
life work shall be comes up, is a basic
thing in government by the people.
Upon the wisdom of this choice turns
the welfare of each unit in the State, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
therefore of the State itself." Hence the
State has no right to refuse to one any
opportunity of preparing himself to exercise
this freedom of choice which it accords
to another. There has never been
a time since 1647 when the laws of Massachusetts
did not require certain towns
to maintain grammar schools, of which
the high schools are the modern equivalents,
at public expense, and when the
colony became a State a perpetual obligation
was imposed upon the Legislature
and magistrates "to cherish the
interests of literature and the sciences
and all seminaries of them, especially
the university at Cambridge, public
schools, and grammar schools in the
towns."</p>

<p><b>Degeneration.</b>&mdash;Dr. William C.
Krauss, in a paper on The Stigmata of
Degeneration, describes degeneration as
meaning, in pathology, the substitution
of a tissue by some other regarded as
less highly organized, less complex in
structure, of inferior physiological rank,
or less suited for the performance of the
original function. The same definition
may apply equally well, according to Dr.
Krauss, in human ontogeny, "where we
can regard a normal man as possessing
a certain number of units of strength
capable of supplying or exerting a certain
number of units of work or force,
varying of course according to the environment,
education, and fixity of purpose
of the individual. It would be obviously
unfair to compare a professional
man or a brain-worker, whose units of
work are intuitively manifold more than
a hand-worker, and declare the latter a
degenerate because his force and energy,
as measured by the world's standard, are
not as productive as the former. The
questions of money standard and time-worth
are foreign to the laws of degeneracy,
and are not to be regarded in
any way. The degenerate must be considered
solely and alone upon the physical,
mental, and abnormal stigmata
which brand him as an abnormal or
atypical man, and prevent him from exerting
himself to the highest limit commensurate
with his skill and development."
The author's paper treats in detail
of the various aspects of degeneracy.</p>

<p><b>Birds as Pest Destroyers.</b>&mdash;The
French journal, <i>Le Chasseur</i>, puts in
a plea for the animals that should not
be killed. "Why destroy spiders, except
in rooms, while they check the increase
of flies? Why tread on the cricket in
the garden, which wars upon caterpillars,
snails, and grubs? Why kill the
inoffensive slowworm, which eats grasshoppers?
Why slay the cuckoo, whose
favorite food is the caterpillar, which we
do not like to touch? Why destroy the
nuthatch and de-nest the warbler, foes
of wasps? Why make war on sparrows,
which eat seeds only when they can not
get insects, and which exterminate so
many grain-eating insects? Why burn
powder against starlings, which pass
their lives in eating larv&aelig; and picking
vermin from the cattle in the fields?
(But they eat grapes too.) Why destroy
the ladybird, which feeds on aphides?
Why lay snares for titmice, when each
pair take on an average one hundred and
twenty thousand worms and insects for
their little ones? Why kill the toad,
which eats snails, weevils, and ants?
Why save the lives of thousands of gnats
by destroying goat-suckers? Why kill
the bat, which makes war on night
moths and many bugs, as swallows do
on flies? Why destroy the shrew mole,
which lives on earthworms, as the mouse
does on wheat? Why say the screech
owl eats pigeons and chickens, when it is
not true, and why destroy it when it
takes the place of seven or eight cats
by eating at least six thousand mice a
year?"</p>

<p><b>The Yang-tse-Kiang.</b>&mdash;In a lecture
before the London Foreign Press Association
Mrs. Isabella Bishop describes
the Yank-tse-Kiang as one of the largest
rivers of the world, it draining an area
of 650,000 square miles, within which
dwell a population of 180,000,000. In
the journey to the far East, the scenery
at Szu-chuan changed from savage grandeur
and endless surprises to the fairest
scenes, with prosperity, peace, law, and
order seeming to prevail everywhere.
Erroneous ideas were often entertained
about Chinese social life and surroundings.
China had many trade associations,
which were often strengthened by
alliance with guilds. They were composed
of men in any particular trade or
employment, who bound themselves for
common action in the interest of that
trade. They might rightly be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
trade unions, for through their elected
officers they prescribed hours of labor
and minimum wages and made trade
rules, the breach of which was punishable
by fine and expulsion. The Chinese
people displayed much benevolence and
social kindness one to another, and had
societies for providing free coffins and
seemly burial in free cemeteries for the
poor, soup kitchens, foundling institutions,
asylums, orphanages, and medical
dispensaries. Throughout the whole of
the Yang-tse basin the author was impressed
with the completeness of Chinese
social and commercial organization
by the existence of patriotism or public
spirit, by great prosperity, and by the
absence of the decay often attributed to
the nation. Of the prevailing "expansion"
or territorial robbery fever Mrs.
Bishop said that we were coming to
think only of markets and territories,
and to ignore human beings, and were
breaking up, in the case of a fourth of
the human race, the most ancient of the
earth's existing civilizations without giving
for our supposed advantage a fair
equivalent.</p>

<p><b>"Somewhat" Poisonous Plants.</b>&mdash;In
Prof. B. D. Halsted's paper in the
State Agricultural Experiment Station
Bulletins on The Poisonous Plants of
New Jersey, besides the descriptions of
plants recognized as poisonous internally
and to the touch, a list is given
of "many somewhat poisonous plants."
Among these the catalpa and ailantus
produce emanations that are disagreeable
and sometimes poisonous, and catalpa
flowers, when handled, will produce
an irritation of the skin. The thorn
of the Osage orange leaves a poisoned
wound. The young leaves of the red
cedar and the arbor vit&aelig; are irritating
to the skin and may produce blisters,
and the pitch of the spruce causes itching.
Balm of Gilead may cause blistering.
The green bark of the club of Hercules
is irritating to the skin. The
herbage of oleander affects some persons
like poison ivy, the bark of the daphne
causes blisters, and the juice of the box
produces an itching with many persons.
To some the herbage of the wild clematis
is acrid and unpleasant. Many of the
wild herbs have acrid properties, among
them skunk cabbage, Indian turnip, cow
parsnip, several of the mustards, and
the juice of red pepper and stonecrop.
Garden rue and the short bristles of the
borage are irritating. Some persons have
had their skin inflamed by handling the
garden nasturtium. Other plants not always
pleasant to handle are meadow-saffron
bulbs, garlic, juice of bloodwort
and celandine, the smartweed, the herbage
of the poke, monkshood, larkspur,
bearberry, some of the buttercups, anemone,
star cucumber, various burs, daisy
flowers, hairy plants, the nettles, sneeze-weed,
the corpse plant, and some of the
toadstools. Flax spinners have a flax
poison, jute workers a rash, hop pickers
a disagreeable irritation of the hands,
and the grinders of mandrake root find
the powder irritating to the face. It is
not unusual for persons who gather
plants in field and forest to receive sensations
akin to those produced by mosquitoes,
which are often chargeable to
the plants. Other animals than man are
less susceptible to the effects of contact
poisons.</p>

<p><b>The Dangers of Hypnotism.</b>&mdash;In a
review of the medico-legal aspects of
hypnotism Dr. Sydney Kuh inquires
whether the hypnotized can be injured
physically or mentally by hypnotization,
and whether they can fall victims to
crime. Summing up a number of cases
cited as bearing on the former question,
he finds that hypnotism is now generally
conceded to be a pathological and
not a physiological condition; that its
use, when resorted to too frequently,
is liable to bring on mental deterioration;
that it may be the cause of chronic
headache or of an outbreak of hysteria;
that at times it has an undesirable effect
upon pre-existing mental disease;
and that in some cases it may even
produce an outbreak of insanity. He
has learned of a few cases on record
in which hypnotism was directly or indirectly
responsible for the death of the
patient. On the other hand, "we all
know that hypnotism is a useful therapeutic
agent practically only in cases of
functional disease which only very rarely
endangers the patient's life." Seeking
simpler, less dangerous methods of treating
maladies for which hypnotism has
been recommended, the author has experimented
upon the use of suggestion
in the waking state, with results that
encourage him. A large series of cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
convinced him that a hypodermic injection
of <i>aqua destillata</i>, given under
proper precautions and circumstances,
so as to impress the patient deeply, will
produce very nearly, if not quite, as
many cures as hypnotization. As for the
other question, laboratory experiments
indicate that a hypnotized person may
be induced to commit acts bearing the
aspect of crime, but that when the case
becomes a serious one something will
most likely occur in the mind of the patient
or the conditions to prevent the
consummation. The result is too uncertain
and difficult, and the risks are too
many and various, even to permit the
use of hypnotism as an instrument of
crime to become common or really dangerous.
And the author's conclusion is
that the dangers of hypnotism lie much
more in its use for experimental and
therapeutical than for criminal purposes.</p>

<p><b>Instruction of the Deaf and
Dumb.</b>&mdash;Of the two principal methods
of instructing deaf-mutes in this country,
as defined by Mr. J. C. Gordon, of
the Illinois Institution, in the sign method,
deaf-mutes are taught a peculiar language
of motions of the arm and upper
part of the body, to which they learn
to attach signification through usage.
For instance, to teach the word <i>cat</i> to
a deaf child a sign teacher would show
the child a cat or a picture of a cat.
He would next direct attention to the
cat's whiskers, drawing the thumb and
finger of each hand lightly over them.
"A similar motion of the thumb and
hand above the teacher's upper lip at
once becomes a sign for cat." After the
sign has become familiar the child is
trained to write the word cat on a slate,
blackboard, or sheet of paper, and by
frequent repetition the pupil associates
the written word with the sign for cat,
so that the written word recalls the gestural
sign, and the gestural sign serves
to recall the concept cat. This language
is acquired more readily than any other
means of communication. The other
method is the intuitive, direct, or English-language
method, and, while it
would require the use of the living cat
or the recognition of the picture of a
cat by the deaf child, would connect the
written or spoken word directly with
the object, without the intervention of
any artificial finger-sign. Wherever
this method prevails the English language
in its written or spoken forms,
or in its finger-spelled form, becomes the
ordinary means of communication between
teachers and pupils, so that every
step in instruction requires the use of
the English language, which is practically
both the instrument and the immediate
end of instruction. All the
schools called oral use this method. It
can be used in connection with finger-spelling,
but not with the sign method.</p>

<p><b>Experiments in Nature Study.</b>&mdash;Some
very interesting features of school
children's Nature study&mdash;not the teaching
of science, but the seeing and understanding
of the common objects of the
external world&mdash;are illustrated in a report
of Cornell Agricultural Experiment
Station, from incidents of school life in
some of the New York schools. The
children in the sixth grade of one of the
schools of Saratoga Springs provided
themselves with eggshells filled with
earth and sown with wheat. "The botanical
side was made a lesson well flavored
with active interest. The pride
of ownership and a plant coming from a
spoonful of earth had the charm of a
creation all the pupil's own, and it was
much more real to study the thing itself
than to read about it and make a recitation."
Geographical applications were
made by tracing the introduction and
extension and transportation of the
crop, and by means of the exchange of
correspondence the wheat belt could be
traced and plotted in every State of the
Union. The children of Corning gathered
seeds and divided them into classes
as indicated by the means of travel with
which they are provided. A small boy
felt himself a profound investigator when
he discovered the advantage some seeds
have in being able to float and ride on
the water. It required no hard drill to
learn the names. The summer planting
of flowers by the children of Jamestown
resulted in a flower show in the fall.
Many children took the tent caterpillar,
reared it from the eggs, and learned all
about its metamorphoses. "Nature
study can be made elastic. In the kindergarten
it can be idealized so as to approach
a fairy story. It can be intensified
so that in the high school it will
have all the solidity of pure science."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
The best proof that the idea is bearing
fruit is that teachers are asking for definite
instruction on the subject, and a
course has been provided for them. The
study should be so informal as not to
admit of systematic examination.</p>

<p><b>Chemistry Teaching in Grammar
and High Schools.</b>&mdash;At the fourth
meeting of the New England Association
of Chemistry Teachers, held in Boston
in January, 1899, preliminary reports
were made on grammar-school and
high-school courses in chemistry. The
grammar-school course was defined as
intended to give its pupils first-hand
knowledge of the more obvious and important
facts and principles of chemical
changes, with emphasis placed on those
facts which are illustrative of the
changes that are going on all about the
pupil in the home and in outdoor Nature.
While the point of view should be
that of Nature study rather than of science,
the selection of material and method
of study should be such as to make
the course of greatest value to those
who are to pursue the subject in higher
institutions. For high-school study the
report insists that, before everything
else, the course be intelligible to the
pupil. Whatever experiment or work is
undertaken, it must be such that the
pupil shall be able to understand its aim
and the steps in its pursuit, and it must
not be too intricate in demonstration or
abstruse in application. It should require
at least five hours a week, and, if
possible, too, of these periods consecutive,
and should come as late in the curriculum
as possible, following physics.
The general work may be divided into
the heads of historical, informational
(qualitative and quantitative), and theoretical,
the second division having ordinarily
the larger part of the time. The
belief is expressed that only part of the
demonstration work should be done by
the teacher in the class, but most of it
should be performed, as far as practicable,
by each pupil in the laboratory.
Lastly, the report recommends that the
humanistic side of the science be made
as prominent as possible. Whenever
facts in chemistry can be related to human
life or activity this should be done.</p>


<h3>MINOR PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

<p>In a recent report on the educational
work of the Passaic (New Jersey) public
schools, Superintendent F. E. Spaulding
points out one of the worst faults of our
present public-school system. "The true
function of education is to foster and direct
the growth of children, not to teach
so many pages, rules, facts, or precepts of
this subject or of that. And the one adequate
rule of practice is constantly to
meet the growing needs of this and that
individual child, not to teach this class
of children as a class. From this proposition
there follows the corollary, which
is amply substantiated in practice, that
the time, order, method, and extent of
presenting any subject can be rightly determined
only by the interest and capacity
of the child for whose benefit it is to
be presented, not by the logic and practical
importance of the subject itself."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Sir James Grant</span>, of Ottawa,
has been led, by his studies of the alimentary
canal in its function of discharging
the secretions of the various glands, to a
high appreciation of the importance of
its operation in connection with the elaborate
and complex nervous system associated
with it. It is reasonable, he believes,
to suppose that the activity of
these nerves is injuriously affected by
noxious influences long before any evidence
of organic disease appears, and
that, hence, want of care in the digestive
process can not and does not fail "to
bring about results of a most telling
character in the very process of sanguinification."
Believing that irregularities
of the digestive process in the alimentary
canal are more frequent than is generally
supposed, he holds that "the internal
sewage of the system" can not be too
critically examined with a view of preventing
the ill effect of toxic accumulations
upon the nerve centers. "That
the recently discovered neurones," he
adds, "play an important part in the
vitalizing of nerve energy is a reasonable
deduction. A path is now open in which
life, under ordinary circumstances, <i>may
be prolonged</i>, provided no organic disease
is present."</p>

<p>The courses in biology in the University
of Pennsylvania have been arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
with reference to the needs of students
who desire instruction in the biological
sciences for general culture, as a preparation
for teaching or original investigation,
or as a foundation for the professional
course in medicine. They include
in the courses in arts and sciences the
electives, the biology-chemistry group,
and the botany-zo&ouml;logy group, each set
including several classes; the four-year
course in biology, which appeals particularly
to students who wish to become
teachers or to take up special work as investigators
in biology, and the two-years'
course in biology, which is designed especially
for those who desire some systematic
training in natural science before
taking up the study of medicine.
Both of these courses are open to men
and women alike. An ample equipment
is provided for the biological department
in the shape of spacious class rooms and
laboratories, a botanic garden, an herbarium,
a vivarium, zo&ouml;logical and auxiliary
collections, a marine laboratory at
Sea Isle, New Jersey, tables at Woods
Holl, library facilities, two serial publications,
and clubs and societies.</p>

<p>We learn from the London Lancet
that besides the special ward of twelve
beds at the Royal Southern Hospital of
Liverpool, which was formally opened
by Lord Lister on April 29th last, arrangements
have been completed for a
school for the study of tropical diseases
at Liverpool. Lord Lister, on the
occasion of the school's foundation, said:
"The medical student in the ordinary
hospital has rare opportunities of seeing
these diseases, and for a man who
is about to practice in the tropics it is
essential that he have opportunities for
studying them here before embarking on
his tropical career. The possession of
tropical colonies makes such institutions
in the home country very necessary, not
only for preparing the colonial doctors,
but for the protection of the home population,
which is sure to be brought into
contact more or less with the infectious
tropical diseases."</p>

<p>An interesting paper by Mr. C. J.
Coleman on The Electrical Protection of
Safes and Vaults is described in the Electrical
World and Engineer. He divided
the methods into two systems, in one the
alarm depending on the opening and the
other on the closing of a circuit&mdash;the latter
of the two being the one most in use.
Among the curious devices mentioned
are cementing narrow tin-foil strips on
the inner surfaces of window glass, so
that any breakage or fracture of the
glass will open the circuit; the use of
glass tubes filled with mercury and connected
in circuit, or tubes filled with
water or compressed air. In reply to questions
as to the use of electricity in perforating
safes it was stated that a five-ply
chrome steel safe, seven inches and a
half thick, was burned through by three
hundred amp&egrave;res in twenty-five minutes,
and holes were burned through a solid
block of vault steel twelve inches thick
in twenty-six minutes with three hundred
and fifty amp&egrave;res, and in fifteen
minutes with five hundred amp&egrave;res.</p>

<p>The foundation stone of an oceanographic
museum, instituted by Prince
Albert of Monaco, was laid in that city
April 25th. The museum is designed,
primarily, to receive the large and valuable
collections obtained by the prince in
the voyages of ocean exploration which
he has conducted, and to become a general
depository for oceanographic spoils.
The principal address was made by
the governor-general, who glorified the
prince's meritorious scientific career.
The German Emperor, who is named a
patron of the museum, and the French
President were represented on the occasion
by deputies.</p>

<p>The City Library Association of
Springfield, Mass., has been holding, during
April, May, and June, an elaborate
and instructive exhibit of geographic appliances
of special interest to teachers in
the elementary schools. The exhibition
included a number of sets of wall maps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
relief maps and globes, models for use in
structural geography, pictures, photographs,
etc., of geographical features,
aids in teaching, geographical texts,
manuals and treatises, books of travel,
and an exhibit of geographical work
done in the elementary schools of Springfield
and vicinity. The association has
also published a brief Bibliography of
Geographical Instruction, which was
prepared by W. S. Monroe, of the State
Normal School at Westfield, Mass.</p>

<p>Dr. Daniel G. Brinton has presented
to the University of Pennsylvania,
where he is Professor of American Arch&aelig;ology

of books and manuscripts relating
to the aboriginal languages of North
and South America. The collection represents
the work of twenty-five years,
and embraces about two thousand titles.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Carnegie has offered
to complete, with a contribution of &pound;50,000,
a fund which Mr. Joseph Chamberlain

England.</p>

<p>A noteworthy experiment in bird
protection has been made in a boys'
school at Coupvray, France, by forming
a society of the pupils for that purpose.
The president, vice-president, and
secretary of the society are selected
from among the pupils of the first division,
and all the other pupils are
members. Meetings are held every Saturday
afternoon in March, April, May,
June, and July, under the presidency of
the teacher, to hear the reports of members
and record the nests protected and
noxious animals destroyed in a notebook
kept for the purpose. In 1898,
570 nests were protected by the school,
and more than 400 mice, rats, weasels,
and dormice were destroyed. Such societies
cost nothing, and are capable of
rendering great service.</p>

<p>Ernest D. Bell, whose formula for
determining animal longevity by the
length of the period of maturity was
published in a recent Monthly, has sent
a later communication to Nature, changing
his constant from 10.5 to 10.1, the
latter figure giving much better results.</p>

<p>The report of Mr. J. C. Hopkins on
the Clays and Clay Industries of Western
Pennsylvania is the second one of a series
of economic reports on the natural resources
of the State in course of publication
by the Pennsylvania State College.
The first report, published in 1897, was
on the Brown Stones of Pennsylvania.
The report represents that a capital of
nearly $7,000,000 is invested in the clay
industries about Pittsburg, of which
more than $3,000,000 are in the fire-clay
industry. The value of the annual output
of material is nearly $4,000,000, more
than fifty per cent of the capital invested.
The 139 companies employ 4,403 men.</p>

<p>Herr Hansemann, of the University
of Berlin, who examined the skull
of Helmholtz, reports in the <i>Zeitschrift
f&uuml;r Psychologie</i> that he found the head
about the size of Bismarck's, and a little
smaller than Wagner's. By metrical
standards the brain weighed about 1,700
grammes with the coagulated blood, and
about 1,440 grammes without it&mdash;about
100 grammes more than the average.
The circumvolutions, which are now
thought to have more relation to mental
capacity than mere weight, were particularly
deep and well marked. The
skull was 55 centimetres in circumference,
15.5 centimetres broad, and 18.3
centimetres long, and the cephalic index
was 85.25.</p>
